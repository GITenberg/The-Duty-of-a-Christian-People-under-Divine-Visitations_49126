</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> aspect of the times, upon a
careful survey, presents, to the thoughtful mind, cause of
anxiety for the safety and welfare of the empire; and, to the
religious mind, ground for apprehension, lest the Almighty should
be about to visit, for the sins of the nations, by &ldquo;pouring
upon them the vials of His wrath.&rdquo; <a
name="citation3a"></a><a href="#footnote3a"
class="citation">[3a]</a>&nbsp; In the emphatic language of our
Lord&rsquo;s prediction of the latter days; there is, throughout
Europe, &ldquo;distress of nations with perplexity; men&rsquo;s
hearts failing them for fear; and for looking after those things
which are coming upon the earth.&rdquo; <a
name="citation3b"></a><a href="#footnote3b"
class="citation">[3b]</a>&nbsp; In this country, to an alarming
state of popular excitement, there has supervened a new cause of
dread, so great, as almost to absorb, for the present, all
subjects of merely temporal interest.&nbsp; A fearful and most
fatal pestilence, which <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>had extended far and wide in Asia, has
been gradually spreading throughout Europe, and steadily
advancing towards our shores: there exists a difference of
opinion as to whether or not it has reached them; but thus much
is certain; an epidemic, similar in character, and hardly less
malignant and fatal, has broken out in one of the seaports of the
kingdom, and extended to some of the neighbouring towns and
villages; thus appearing to establish its identity with the
Continental disease.</p>
<p>Under circumstances so calculated to produce general
apprehension, and so full of danger to the community at large, it
becomes a matter of vital importance to enquire, What is the
course a Christian people should adopt?&nbsp; To such an enquiry,
the sincere Christian,&mdash;who is satisfied, that the safety of
nations and of individuals is, at all times, in the protection of
the Almighty; and who believes, that the sword, the famine, the
earthquake, the tempest, and the pestilence, are but instruments
in the hand of God to execute His sovereign and gracious
will,&mdash;may justly reply in the words of a prophet of old,
speaking in the name of the Most High: &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Therefore</span>, <span class="smcap">also</span>,
<span class="smcap">now saith the lord</span>, <span
class="smcap">turn ye even to me</span>, <span class="smcap">with
all your heart</span>, <span class="smcap">and with
fasting</span>, <span class="smcap">and with weeping</span>,
<span class="smcap">and with mourning</span>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">And rend your heart</span>, <span class="smcap">and
not your garments</span>, <span class="smcap">and turn unto the
lord your god</span>: <span class="smcap">for he is gracious and
merciful</span>, <span class="smcap">slow to anger</span>, <span
class="smcap">and of great kindness</span>, <span
class="smcap">and repenteth</span> <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span><span class="smcap">him of the
evil</span>.&rdquo; <a name="citation5a"></a><a
href="#footnote5a" class="citation">[5a]</a>&nbsp; And how is a
whole nation to be called upon to humble themselves before God in
the day of their visitation?&nbsp; Let the same Prophet return
the answer; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Blow the trumpet in
zion</span>, <span class="smcap">sanctify a fast</span>, <span
class="smcap">call a solemn assembly</span>, <span
class="smcap">gather the people</span>, <span
class="smcap">sanctify the congregation</span>, <span
class="smcap">assemble the elders</span>, <span
class="smcap">gather the children</span>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Let the priests</span>, <span class="smcap">the
ministers of the lord</span>, <span class="smcap">weep between
the porch and the altar</span>, <span class="smcap">and let them
say</span>, <span class="smcap">spare thy people</span>, <span
class="smcap">o lord</span>.&rdquo; <a name="citation5b"></a><a
href="#footnote5b" class="citation">[5b]</a></p>
<p>As the Almighty, &ldquo;with whom is no variableness, nor
shadow of turning,&rdquo; <a name="citation5c"></a><a
href="#footnote5c" class="citation">[5c]</a> is &ldquo;the same
yesterday, to-day, and for ever;&rdquo; <a
name="citation5d"></a><a href="#footnote5d"
class="citation">[5d]</a> as &ldquo;whatsoever things were
written aforetime, were written for our learning; that we,
through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have
hope:&rdquo; <a name="citation5e"></a><a href="#footnote5e"
class="citation">[5e]</a> let the people of this kingdom, strong
in faith, raise, on an appointed day, their united voice in
prayer; and in the language of sorrow, humiliation, and
repentance, cry, O Lord, &ldquo;we have sinned with our fathers,
we have done amiss and dealt wickedly;&rdquo; <a
name="citation5f"></a><a href="#footnote5f"
class="citation">[5f]</a> but &ldquo;Thou, Lord, art good, and
ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them who call
upon Thee!&rdquo; <a name="citation5g"></a><a href="#footnote5g"
class="citation">[5g]</a>&nbsp; Alas! because we see not the
&ldquo;outstretched arm&rdquo; of Omnipotence, which governeth
the nations; because we hear not the &ldquo;mighty <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>voice&rdquo;
which universal Nature obeys; we too often forget that &ldquo;the
Lord&rsquo;s hand is not shortened that it cannot save, nor his
ear heavy that it cannot hear:&rdquo; <a name="citation6a"></a><a
href="#footnote6a" class="citation">[6a]</a> we too often forget
that it is &ldquo;God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of
the world.&rdquo; <a name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a></p>
<p>But is it sufficient to call upon a people, suffering under
the apprehension or infliction of Divine judgments, to assemble
in the courts of the Lord&rsquo;s house, to acknowledge the
justice of their punishment, and to humble themselves before
their God?&nbsp; Let the volume of inspiration again reply,
&ldquo;To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto
me? saith the Lord?&rdquo; <a name="citation6c"></a><a
href="#footnote6c" class="citation">[6c]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Wash ye</span>, <span class="smcap">make you
clean</span>, <span class="smcap">put away the evil of your
doings before mine eyes</span>; <span class="smcap">cease to do
evil</span>, <span class="smcap">learn to do well</span>, <span
class="smcap">seek judgment</span>, <span class="smcap">relieve
the oppressed</span>, <span class="smcap">judge the
fatherless</span>, <span class="smcap">plead for the
widow</span>.&rdquo; <a name="citation6d"></a><a
href="#footnote6d" class="citation">[6d]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Behold</span>, <span class="smcap">to obey is
better than sacrifice</span>, <span class="smcap">and to hearken
than the fat of rams</span>.&rdquo; <a name="citation6e"></a><a
href="#footnote6e" class="citation">[6e]</a></p>
<p>Much has been effected when a nation has been brought to
prostrate itself before God, and, through a deep sense of its
guilt, weakness, and misery, to flee unto Him, who alone is
mighty to save; but incalculably more has been accomplished, when
to the prayer for mercy has been added one for grace; and it has
been truly, not less the language of the heart than of the lips,
&ldquo;Sanctify to us this thy <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>fatherly correction, that the sense of
our weakness may add strength to our faith, and seriousness to
our repentance.&rdquo; <a name="citation7a"></a><a
href="#footnote7a" class="citation">[7a]</a>&nbsp; May God, of
His great mercy, vouchsafe to the people of this land, &ldquo;to
know the time of their visitation;&rdquo; <a
name="citation7b"></a><a href="#footnote7b"
class="citation">[7b]</a> to humble themselves before Him, who
&ldquo;in faithfulness has caused them to be troubled;&rdquo; <a
name="citation7c"></a><a href="#footnote7c"
class="citation">[7c]</a> to &ldquo;seek the Lord while He may be
found, and to call upon Him while He is near;&rdquo; <a
name="citation7d"></a><a href="#footnote7d"
class="citation">[7d]</a> and to &ldquo;repent and turn
themselves from all their transgressions: so iniquity shall not
be their ruin.&rdquo; <a name="citation7e"></a><a
href="#footnote7e" class="citation">[7e]</a>&nbsp; Oh that the
practical infidelity, which exists to such a fearful extent in
the present day, may not withhold from a suffering people the
deliverance and blessing which God alone can bestow!&nbsp; A
neglect and distrust, if not a denial of God&rsquo;s Providence,
in the preservation and government of nations and individuals, is
one of the most crying sins of the day.&nbsp; Because the natural
eye does not perceive the visible workings of a Divine economy in
the course of events, it practically ascribes all to human means,
and relies on human aid.&nbsp; But, as if &ldquo;the finger of
God&rdquo; was to be revealed as pointing in wrath to this great
truth of natural and revealed religion&mdash;a Divine
providence&mdash;one of the most remarkable and terrible features
of this fatal pestilence, through which so many millions of <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>human beings
have been swept away, is, that whilst human prudence has been
completely baffled in its plans of prevention, human science has
failed in its attempts at cure.&nbsp; What a salutary lesson does
this teach, in a day when earthly is often elevated above
heavenly wisdom in the estimation of men, and when the arm of
flesh appears more confided in than the arm of Omnipotence, for
the accomplishment of events!</p>
<p>May the great Disposer of events, who, in the dispensations of
His Providence, is graciously pleased to educe real good from
seeming evil, make this awful visitation productive of religious
advantage to this and other nations.&nbsp; May earthly sovereigns
learn that the Lord, by whom &ldquo;kings reign, and princes
decree justice,&rdquo; <a name="citation8a"></a><a
href="#footnote8a" class="citation">[8a]</a> is their defence,
and &ldquo;the Holy One of Israel, their King:&rdquo; <a
name="citation8b"></a><a href="#footnote8b"
class="citation">[8b]</a> may the rulers of the people remember,
that &ldquo;except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh
but in vain.&rdquo; <a name="citation8c"></a><a
href="#footnote8c" class="citation">[8c]</a></p>
<p>For although God&rsquo;s providence governs all things in
heaven and in earth, still the great Sovereign of the universe,
&ldquo;the King of kings, and Lord of lords,&rdquo;
&ldquo;waiteth to be gracious,&rdquo; nor suffers His truth to
fail.&nbsp; He shuts not up His loving-kindness in displeasure,
but listens to the prayers of the meanest of His servants; and in
answer to them, He <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>often suspends, and sometimes averts his just
judgments.&nbsp; The guilty cities of the Plain would have been
spared for the sake of ten righteous, if that number of the
servants of the true God could have been found amongst the
inhabitants. <a name="citation9a"></a><a href="#footnote9a"
class="citation">[9a]</a>&nbsp; Nor is the prayer of humble and
contrite guilt disregarded.&nbsp; The judgments impending over
Nineveh were suspended, when that mighty capital, at the
preaching of a prophet, acknowledged its sin, and humbled itself
before the Lord. <a name="citation9b"></a><a href="#footnote9b"
class="citation">[9b]</a></p>
<p>Let, then, the prayer of repentance, faith, and submission,
arise to the throne of Divine grace, from the united people of
the land; and, soon as the merciful object of this visitation is
answered, we may humbly trust the command, as of old, will be
addressed to the destroying angel, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">It
is enough</span>, <span class="smcap">now stay thine
hand</span>.&rdquo; <a name="citation9c"></a><a
href="#footnote9c" class="citation">[9c]</a>&nbsp; For the
Almighty has himself declared, &ldquo;At what instant I shall
speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up,
and to pull down, and to destroy it: if that nation, <span
class="smcap">against whom i have pronounced</span>, <span
class="smcap">turn from their evil</span>, <span class="smcap">i
will repent of the evil that i thought to do unto
them</span>.&rdquo; <a name="citation9d"></a><a
href="#footnote9d" class="citation">[9d]</a></p>
<p>May, then, this nation receive grace, in this their day of
trial, to &ldquo;<span class="smcap">turn from their
evil</span>,&rdquo; before the Lord &ldquo;allow His full
displeasure to arise.&rdquo;&nbsp; May they learn and
acknowledge, that their only hope <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>of safety is in the mercy and
long-suffering of God, who alone can preserve them from
&ldquo;the pestilence which walketh in darkness, and from the
sickness which destroyeth in the noon-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; May they
&ldquo;offer faithfully,&rdquo; and the Lord &ldquo;receive
acceptably,&rdquo; their prayer for deliverance: &ldquo;Have
pity, O Lord, have pity upon Thy people, both here and abroad;
withdraw Thy heavy hand from those who are suffering under Thy
judgments; and remove from us that grievous calamity, against
which, our only security is in Thy compassion!&rdquo; <a
name="citation10a"></a><a href="#footnote10a"
class="citation">[10a]</a>&nbsp; And may our gracious and
long-suffering Lord be pleased to arrest in its course the
pestilence, now confined to few places, and to permit it not to
spread dismay and death through the towns and villages of the
kingdom.</p>
<p>Thus far, the duty of a Christian people <i>collectively</i>,
under Divine judgments, has been shewn; it remains to consider
their duty <i>individually</i>; which involves the consideration
of what man owes to his God, his country, his neighbour, and
himself, under any general visitation of Divine Providence.&nbsp;
The Christian&rsquo;s duty towards God, when His judgments are
abroad, is a recognition of, and submission to, His chastening
hand: to his country, unwearied exertion for the removal of the
evils which appear <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>to have called down the Divine vengeance: to his
neighbour, friendly assistance, religious exhortation, and
spiritual consolation: and to himself, through Divine grace,
humiliation, repentance, amendment, and daily preparation for
death and judgment.</p>
<p>These several duties, being all dependent upon each other, and
intimately blended in their operation, may, perhaps, be not
unfitly considered, as embraced by the public and private
obligations of Christians under afflictive dispensations; which
may be briefly stated to be&mdash;earnest prayer and incessant
labour to effect a <span class="GutSmall">PERSONAL
REFORMATION</span>, and, as far as in them lies, a <span
class="GutSmall">NATIONAL REFORMATION</span>; which are proposed
to be considered, as follows, more at large.</p>
<p>Let individuals &ldquo;humble themselves under the mighty hand
of God;&rdquo; <a name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a> let them acknowledge the extent of
their sinfulness, and the justice of their punishment; let them
confide in God&rsquo;s mercy, and commit themselves to His safe
keeping; let them seek for grace to reform, in their lives and
conversation, whatever is at variance with the Gospel; from
which, and not from the maxims of men, let them learn what is
required of Christians.</p>
<p>Let them publicly bear testimony at once to the justice and
mercy of God&rsquo;s judgments, and strive earnestly to rouse the
nation to a sense of its guiltiness, which has exposed it to the
Divine displeasure; <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>let them, in dependence on the blessing of Heaven,
labour to eradicate all infidel and heretical opinions; to
advance a reformation of public morals; and to promote a general
diffusion of true religion, sound learning, and useful
knowledge.</p>
<p>Too justly does the language of Isaiah, addressed to the
rebellious and guilty house of Judah, apply to our own times:
&ldquo;Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of
evil-doers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the
Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger, they
are gone backward.&rdquo; <a name="citation12a"></a><a
href="#footnote12a" class="citation">[12a]</a>&nbsp; May He,
&ldquo;who alone can order the unruly wills and affections of
sinful men,&rdquo; and convert them from the evil of their ways,
&ldquo;pour upon all flesh the spirit of grace and
supplication;&rdquo; <a name="citation12b"></a><a
href="#footnote12b" class="citation">[12b]</a> that individual
may extend, until it become national repentance, and the whole
nation worship before Him.&nbsp; Then will the scourge of His
wrath prove the harbinger of His mercy, and we shall become a
chosen people, a holy nation unto the Lord.&nbsp; Then may our
gracious and long-suffering God allow us, without presumption, to
draw comfort from those words of favour and forgiveness, spoken
to His people when humbled and contrite: &ldquo;Remember these, O
Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant; I have formed thee,
thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me:
I have blotted out as a thick cloud <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>thy transgressions, and as a cloud
thy sins: return unto me, for I have redeemed thee.&rdquo; <a
name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a"
class="citation">[13a]</a></p>
<h3>I.&nbsp; The Christian&rsquo;s duty of personal reformation
under Divine judgments.</h3>
<p>It is from the volume of inspiration&mdash;whence he derives
all the light which he enjoys, as to the providence, beneficence,
and love of God; whence he draws all the knowledge he possesses
as to the nature of his own being, the object of his present
existence, and the place of his final destination;&mdash;man must
learn his duty under the Divine dispensations.&nbsp; The Holy
Scriptures are to the true Christian &ldquo;a lamp unto his feet,
and a light unto his paths.&rdquo; <a name="citation13b"></a><a
href="#footnote13b" class="citation">[13b]</a>&nbsp; When
pursuing his heavenward journey through this vale of tears, the
prospect often appears uninviting and gloomy, the sky dark and
troubled, and the way, always narrow, becomes sometimes a thorny
and tangled path.&nbsp; Dangers also, more or less near and
alarming, keep the pilgrim often under apprehension, and always
on his guard.&nbsp; Still, he pursues a straight-forward course,
from which he deviates little&mdash;for he possesses a guide more
unerring than the compass of the mariner, and that guide is the
infallible Word of God.&nbsp; When darkness obscures,
difficulties perplex, and dangers environ his road, in his
unfailing &ldquo;lamp&rdquo; he finds light, guidance, and
safety.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>At this
moment, a dark cloud hangs over this country:&mdash;nay, more,
the storm of Divine displeasure has already commenced.&nbsp;
Lest, therefore, it should burst upon us in its full
&ldquo;fury,&rdquo; let all betake themselves to that blessed
light, which, amid the thickest darkness and most appalling
storm, can &ldquo;guide our feet into the way of peace.&rdquo; <a
name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a"
class="citation">[14a]</a>&nbsp; Let the enquiry be made as to
the course to be adopted in the words of a Prophet:
&ldquo;<i>What will ye do in the day of visitation</i>, <i>and in
the desolation which shall come from far</i>?&nbsp; <i>To whom
will ye flee for help</i>?&rdquo; <a name="citation14b"></a><a
href="#footnote14b" class="citation">[14b]</a>&nbsp; Let the same
Prophet reply: &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Trust ye in the lord
for ever</span>, <span class="smcap">for in the lord jehovah is
everlasting strength</span>.&rdquo; <a name="citation14c"></a><a
href="#footnote14c" class="citation">[14c]</a></p>
<p>Trust in God is the necessary fruit of faith, which is the
only basis on which religion can rest: &ldquo;he that cometh to
God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them
that diligently seek Him:&rdquo; <a name="citation14d"></a><a
href="#footnote14d" class="citation">[14d]</a> thus, except with
one philosophical school of antiquity, a belief in the being of a
God has, even amongst the Heathen, always been accompanied by a
trust in His Providence.&nbsp; In the Christian scheme, this
trust is a fixed, governing principle.&nbsp; &ldquo;To take
notice of the hand of God in every thing that befalls us,&rdquo;
says the learned and excellent Sherlock, &ldquo;to attribute all
the evils we <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>suffer, and all the good things, to His sovereign will
and appointment: this is the foundation of all the other duties
which we owe to Providence, and the general neglect of this makes
us defective in all the rest.&rdquo; <a name="citation15a"></a><a
href="#footnote15a" class="citation">[15a]</a></p>
<p>This passage supplies a clear view of Christian duty under
afflictive dispensations.&nbsp; As faith recognises an Almighty
Father&rsquo;s will in the appointment, and His hand in the
direction of events, the believer refers equally national and
individual prosperity and adversity, mercies and visitations, to
Him, &ldquo;whose power ruleth over all.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as he
refers all events to the will and appointment of the great
Governor of the Universe, he endeavours to receive whatever
befalls him, as coming from His hand, with patient submission and
humble thankfulness: for he knows how immeasurably his punishment
falls short of his deserts; and he is assured, that &ldquo;<i>God
chastens us for our profit</i>, <i>that we might be partakers of
His holiness</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation15b"></a><a
href="#footnote15b" class="citation">[15b]</a>&nbsp; At the same
time, therefore, that he relies with firm dependence on the
tender mercies, the blessed guidance, and sure protection of his
Heavenly Father; he seeks for grace to improve to the spiritual
advancement of himself and others, the divine
chastisements,&mdash;&ldquo;chastisements which originate in
love, and are tempered with mercy:&rdquo; <a
name="citation15c"></a><a href="#footnote15c"
class="citation">[15c]</a> <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>&ldquo;<i>For whom the Lord loveth he
chasteneth</i>, <i>and scourgeth every son whom he
receiveth</i>.&rdquo;<a name="citation16a"></a><a
href="#footnote16a" class="citation">[16a]</a>&nbsp; He enters,
therefore, anew upon a careful review of his past life, and again
summons before the bar of conscience, &ldquo;the sins of his
youth, and the offences of his riper age;&rdquo; he recalls to
mind the warnings he has had, the privileges he has enjoyed, and
the mercies he has received; and he institutes a rigid scrutiny
into his present life, which he tries by the unerring test of
God&rsquo;s holy word.&nbsp; And if he be sincere and honest, and
not a dissembler with God, and a deceiver of himself, the
language will spontaneously burst from his lips; &ldquo;It is
good for me that I have been in trouble, that I may learn Thy
statutes.&rdquo; <a name="citation16b"></a><a href="#footnote16b"
class="citation">[16b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Lord, my strength and
my fortress, my refuge in the day of affliction,&rdquo; <a
name="citation16c"></a><a href="#footnote16c"
class="citation">[16c]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;Turn Thee unto me, and
have mercy upon me, for I am desolate and in misery.&nbsp; The
sorrows of my heart are enlarged; oh, bring Thou me out of my
troubles; look upon my adversity and misery, and forgive me all
my sin.&rdquo; <a name="citation16d"></a><a href="#footnote16d"
class="citation">[16d]</a></p>
<p>Not that probably his life has been stained with deeper or
more numerous offences than the generality of men: it may be that
he has been &ldquo;brought up in the nurture and admonition of
the Lord,&rdquo; and has never departed from serving his God; it
may be <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>that he has long ranked amongst those who strive to be
&ldquo;blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke,
in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, amongst whom they
shine as lights in the world.&rdquo; <a name="citation17a"></a><a
href="#footnote17a" class="citation">[17a]</a>&nbsp; But still
there lives not the man who has not much to repent of, and to
humble himself for, before the Lord.&nbsp; And when the sorrows
of life, the judgments of God, or the approach of death, loosen
the hold of earthly ties upon the affections, and the attention
becomes intently fixed on that invisible world of spirits,
whither all are hastening: then, even he, who has long sought to
serve his God with devout reverence and holy obedience, feels
with stronger force, and sees with clearer view, the fearful
extent of his omissions of duty and commissions of sin.&nbsp;
When he considers that one moment may suffice to usher him into
the presence of that Great Being, of infinite purity, in whose
sight the heavens are not clean; when he remembers the
condemnation passed on all sin by a righteous
law;&mdash;conscious guilt compels him to bow before the Lord
with the deep self-abasement of him who &ldquo;smote upon his
breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner;&rdquo; <a
name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b"
class="citation">[17b]</a> and conscious weakness makes him call
to the Saviour, with the imploring voice of him who cried,
&ldquo;Lord, save me.&rdquo; <a name="citation17c"></a><a
href="#footnote17c" class="citation">[17c]</a>&nbsp; <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>For when the
conscience is fully enlightened, and the heart sanctified by
Divine grace, a clear perception of the holiness of God&rsquo;s
law, and a deep sense of personal unworthiness, are produced in
the believer, which at once humble him to the dust, and lead him
to throw himself entirely on the mercy of God in Christ Jesus our
Lord.&nbsp; Then it is that he labours to devote himself more
entirely to his Master&rsquo;s service, &ldquo;and adorn the
doctrine of God our Saviour in all things:&rdquo; <a
name="citation18a"></a><a href="#footnote18a"
class="citation">[18a]</a> then it is he &ldquo;sets his
affections on things above:&rdquo; <a name="citation18b"></a><a
href="#footnote18b" class="citation">[18b]</a> &ldquo;looking for
that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and
our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might
redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar
people, zealous of good works.&rdquo; <a
name="citation18c"></a><a href="#footnote18c"
class="citation">[18c]</a>&nbsp; And then it is that he takes for
his song in the house of his pilgrimage, &ldquo;I know, O Lord,
that Thy judgments are right, and that Thou of very faithfulness
hast caused me to be afflicted.&rdquo; <a
name="citation18d"></a><a href="#footnote18d"
class="citation">[18d]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;For which cause we faint
not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is
renewed day by day.&nbsp; For our light affliction, which is but
for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory.&nbsp; While we look not at the things which are
seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>things which
are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are
eternal.&rdquo; <a name="citation19a"></a><a href="#footnote19a"
class="citation">[19a]</a></p>
<p>Such is the conduct of the true believer under the chastening
hand of the Lord; such the improvement which, through the Divine
blessing, he is enabled to make of those afflictive
dispensations, which are sent in mercy to remind him, that he is
only a &ldquo;stranger and pilgrim upon earth,&rdquo; and must
&ldquo;desire a better country, that is an heavenly.&rdquo; <a
name="citation19b"></a><a href="#footnote19b"
class="citation">[19b]</a>&nbsp; And when God&rsquo;s judgments
are upon the land, when He has smitten the people with
pestilence, the servant of the Lord rests with firm faith on the
protection of Him, who has promised, as &ldquo;thy days, so shall
thy strength be.&rdquo; <a name="citation19c"></a><a
href="#footnote19c" class="citation">[19c]</a>&nbsp; He knows
that whatever happens to him is by the appointment of God,
without whom even &ldquo;a sparrow shall not fall on the
ground;&rdquo; <a name="citation19d"></a><a href="#footnote19d"
class="citation">[19d]</a> he has further, the blessed assurance,
that &ldquo;all things work together for good, to them who love
God;&rdquo; <a name="citation19e"></a><a href="#footnote19e"
class="citation">[19e]</a> therefore he has all &ldquo;the joy
and peace in believing&rdquo; of those, whose minds being
&ldquo;stayed on God,&rdquo; <a name="citation19f"></a><a
href="#footnote19f" class="citation">[19f]</a> abound in hope
through &ldquo;the power of the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; <a
name="citation19g"></a><a href="#footnote19g"
class="citation">[19g]</a>&nbsp; Not that he supposes he will
possess a necessary exemption from the power of the pestilence;
this would be to presume on God&rsquo;s protection: not that
trusting to Divine <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Providence he neglects all human precautions, and
unnecessarily exposes himself to danger; this would be, in the
strong language of Scripture, to tempt God: not that he relies on
human precautions as supplying any ground of security; this would
be to distrust God.&nbsp; But believing that the pestilence can
have no power over him, except by the Divine appointment; and
being assured, that, if such be the Divine will, it will prove
for his final and eternal welfare; he uses, with entire
dependence on the Divine blessing, the precautions which prudence
dictates; and commending himself to the safe keeping of God, he
faithfully and diligently discharges the duties of his station
and office, whether of pastor, magistrate, citizen, physician, or
servant, or, as they may be included in one word, of
Christian.&nbsp; Not that the believer, whilst he &ldquo;wears
this veil of flesh,&rdquo; is elevated so far above human
infirmity, that, through the power of faith, he knows neither
weakness nor fear in the hour of danger, and in the discharge of
duty.&nbsp; St. Paul&mdash;in allusion to the marvellous change
wrought in the soul, &ldquo;by the light of the knowledge of the
glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ,&rdquo;&mdash;says,
&ldquo;but we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the
excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.&nbsp; We
are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed,
but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but
not destroyed; always <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>bearing about in the body the dying
of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made
manifest in our flesh.&rdquo; <a name="citation21a"></a><a
href="#footnote21a" class="citation">[21a]</a>&nbsp; Still, they
who have learnt, through grace, to confide, with the simplicity
of a child, on the power, care, and love of their heavenly
Father, will, amid difficulties and dangers, &ldquo;prove more
than conquerors, through Him who loved us, and gave Himself for
us;&rdquo; and will repose, with firm faith, pious hope, and holy
confidence, on His protection, <span class="smcap">in whose hands
are the issues of life and death</span>; and who has said, by the
mouth of his prophets, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Thou shalt not
be afraid for any terror by night</span>, <span class="smcap">nor
for the arrow that flieth by day</span>; <span class="smcap">for
the pestilence which walketh in darkness</span>, <span
class="smcap">nor for the sickness which destroyeth in the
noon-day</span>.&nbsp; A thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten
thousand at thy right hand, but it shall not come nigh
thee.&rdquo; <a name="citation21b"></a><a href="#footnote21b"
class="citation">[21b]</a></p>
<p>There are some sincere Christians, who, from natural timidity
of disposition, or from constitutional debility, are peculiarly
susceptible of fear; and distress themselves by considering such
fear a proof that they do not possess the favour of God.&nbsp;
Let them earnestly pray for that holy and firm faith, which
disarms apprehension under great and imminent peril; but if they
do not obtain it, let them not despond, but continue their
prayers; it may be <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>a blessing which Heaven has still in store for
them.&nbsp; But if not, <i>having learnt submission to the Divine
will</i>, let them draw comfort from words which should be so
deeply engraved on the memory, as to be ever remembered, and
speak peace, in their moments of doubt and alarm, to their
troubled souls: &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Fear thou not</span>;
<span class="smcap">for i am with thee</span>: <span
class="smcap">be not dismayed</span>, <span class="smcap">for i
am thy god</span>: <span class="smcap">i will strengthen
thee</span>; <span class="smcap">yea</span>, <span
class="smcap">i will help thee</span>; <span
class="smcap">yea</span>, <span class="smcap">i will uphold thee
with the right hand of my righteousness</span>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation22a"></a><a href="#footnote22a"
class="citation">[22a]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;The truth is, the greater
our fears and sorrows and aversions are, the greater is our
submission to God: it may be thought a great weakness of nature
to be so afraid of our sufferings; but it argues the greater
strength of faith, and is a more glorious victory over self, to
make our very fears and aversions submit to the Divine
will.&nbsp; Submission to God does not consist in courage and
fortitude of mind to bear sufferings, which many have, without
any sense of God, and which the profoundest reverence for God
will not always teach us; but he submits, who receives the bitter
cup and drinks it, though with a trembling heart and hand.&rdquo;
<a name="citation22b"></a><a href="#footnote22b"
class="citation">[22b]</a></p>
<p>Thus much having been stated, that the timid mind or the
sickly frame; the tender plant of grace or &ldquo;the bruised
reed;&rdquo; may not sink under a weight of obligation, the
fulfilment of which is <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>above their present strength; and may
not despair, because they fear they can never attain to that
measure of faith, &ldquo;which, whilst it kisses with filial
reverence the rod of correction,&rdquo; can, in the strong
language of St. Paul, &ldquo;<i>glory in tribulation</i> also;
knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience,
experience; and experience, hope; and hope maketh not ashamed,
because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy
Ghost which is given unto us.&rdquo; <a name="citation23a"></a><a
href="#footnote23a" class="citation">[23a]</a>&nbsp; Let it be
remembered, at the same time, that though none should despond,
because they possess not a strength of faith bestowed only on the
most highly-advanced Christians; still, all must earnestly seek
grace to be enabled to &ldquo;go on unto perfection;&rdquo; <a
name="citation23b"></a><a href="#footnote23b"
class="citation">[23b]</a> by having implanted in their souls
that &ldquo;perfect love, which casteth out fear.&rdquo; <a
name="citation23c"></a><a href="#footnote23c"
class="citation">[23c]</a>&nbsp; And, as undoubting faith,
unrepining submission, and unwearied supplication, are amongst
the leading features of the true Christian character, they alone
can enjoy the consolations of the Gospel of peace, who are
&ldquo;rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing
instant in prayer.&rdquo; <a name="citation23d"></a><a
href="#footnote23d" class="citation">[23d]</a></p>
<p>It is a painful, an awful consideration, how many, in this
Christian land, &ldquo;care for none of these things.&rdquo; <a
name="citation23e"></a><a href="#footnote23e"
class="citation">[23e]</a>&nbsp; I speak not merely of the
profane, the scoffer, the sceptic, and the infidel; of those who
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;make a mock at sin,&rdquo; and, disputing or
disbelieving the truth of Christianity, &ldquo;live without God
in the world;&rdquo;&mdash;I speak also of the gay, the
thoughtless, and the proud; of the worldly, the avaricious, and
the sensual; of the envious, the malicious, and the censorious;
and, with shame be it said, of unworthy and false professors and
teachers; of the unsound in faith and morals; of the lukewarm,
the self-righteous, and the hypocritical; in short, of all who,
declaring a belief in the Christian faith, either mistake its
doctrines, disregard its spirit, abuse its privileges, or live
unmindful of its strict and holy obligations.&nbsp; Against all
such the Gospel denounces condemnation and woe.&nbsp; How, then,
are they prepared to meet the awful dispensation of Divine
Providence, which has fallen upon the nation?&nbsp; Let the
prophet&rsquo;s enquiry be addressed to them:&mdash;&ldquo;What
will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which
shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Will ye dare to say, &ldquo;O Lord, my strength and my fortress,
my refuge in the day of affliction?&rdquo;&nbsp; What! can ye in
sickness apply to God for relief, who in health were
&ldquo;lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God?&rdquo; <a
name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a>&nbsp; Can ye in affliction seek comfort
of God, who in joy have by your actions denied God?&nbsp; Can ye
in adversity flee to God, who in prosperity had not God in all <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>your
thoughts? <a name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25"
class="citation">[25]</a>&nbsp; They who have never really
sought, and submitted to the guidance of the Gospel, cannot hope
to possess its support and consolations in the first hour of
need.&nbsp; How dark, therefore, to such, is the season of
sickness, of sorrow, and of adversity: they enjoy no light from
above, no comfort from within, no consolation from without, which
can brighten the gloomy mind, cheer the desponding heart, and
soothe the alarmed conscience.&nbsp; Faithful and busy memory
serves only to supply a painful retrospect of opportunities
neglected, and warnings despised: and conscience, which had long
slumbered in a deadly lethargy, often now inflicts her sharpest
stings upon the wretched sufferer.&nbsp; And should they be
arrested by the sudden stroke of a fatal malady, when living in
forgetfulness of God, and intently occupied with the pursuit of
pleasure, honour, or of gain; how terrible is the approach of
death!&nbsp; How often, as this life is fading from the darkening
eye, do the realities of the next burst upon the mind, with a
distinctness and force never felt before!&nbsp; How often, as the
soul is trembling on the fearful verge of eternity, is a vain
wish entertained for the return of a brief portion of that time
which has been spent in sin, folly, or the acquisition of what
will not profit in a dying hour!&nbsp; But is the prayer for
mercy, extorted <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>by fear and suffering, never heard; is the tardy
repentance never accepted?&nbsp; On the contrary, we believe the
prayer of humble and contrite guilt to be never rejected: but, be
it remembered, at the same time, that repentance is the gift of
God, and that those who long trifle with their day of grace, and
by silencing the admonitions of conscience, resist the Spirit,
may be visited with the fearful punishment of judicial blindness
and final impenitence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because I have called, and ye
refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded: but
ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my
reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity, and will mock when
your fear cometh; <i>when your fear cometh as desolation</i>,
<i>and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind</i>, <i>when
distress and anguish cometh upon you</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then shall
they call upon me</i>, <i>but I will not answer</i>; <i>they
shall seek me early</i>, <i>but they shall not find me</i>: for
that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the
Lord; they would none of my counsel, they despised all my
reproof.&rdquo; <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a></p>
<p>From this fearful denunciation of Divine wrath upon obstinate
and hardened disobedience, what an awful lesson may be learnt,
under the present circumstances of this country.&nbsp; How
descriptive are many of the terms employed of that fatal
pestilence <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>which has broken out in the land! in the suddenness of
the seizure, it resembles &ldquo;<span class="smcap">the
whirlwind</span>;&rdquo; by its destructiveness, it causes
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">desolation</span>;&rdquo; and from the
intensity of the sufferings which it produces, arise &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">distress and anguish</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; God grant
that the threatened vengeance be not equally
verified;&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Then shall they call
upon me</span>, <span class="smcap">but i will not answer</span>;
<span class="smcap">they shall seek me early</span>, <span
class="smcap">but they shall not find me</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh!
let not any individual risk incurring such a fearful doom by
delaying his repentance!&nbsp; The Lord now calls every one with
a voice that all must hear; He has &ldquo;bared an arm,&rdquo;
which all must see; let not any longer refuse, let not any longer
disregard, lest they should fill up the measure of their
iniquity, and be swept away by the blast of Divine
displeasure!&nbsp; Let not any trust to that, at all times
presumptuous, if not always fallacious, hope, a death-bed
repentance.&nbsp; That man, whose existence hangs upon a thread,
which a moment may suffice to snap, should defer his preparation
for death and judgment, is such an act of madness, that nothing
but a knowledge of its certainty could make a religious mind
credit the fact.&nbsp; What! risk an eternity of joy or misery on
the chances of a moment! for beyond the present moment, man
possesses no security of the continuance of life.&nbsp; And the
very presumption which leads him to calculate upon long years to
come may call forth that awful sentence,&mdash;&ldquo;Thou fool,
<a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>this night
thy soul shall be required of thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; But if the
postponement of turning and calling upon God be, under ordinary
circumstances, full of presumption and danger, what is it now in
times of pestilence?&nbsp; From the many instances of mortality
which encompass us on every side, &ldquo;there comes a voice,
which solemn sounding bids the world prepare.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
judgments of the Almighty,&mdash;to those who are living in
forgetfulness of Him, and disobedience to His commands, but have
not entirely thrown off His service,&mdash;speak the language
addressed to Jonah, &ldquo;What meanest thou, O sleeper?&nbsp;
Arise, and call upon thy God.&rdquo; <a name="citation28a"></a><a
href="#footnote28a" class="citation">[28a]</a>&nbsp; But to those
who refuse to turn, who &ldquo;harden their necks against the
reproof, and will have none of the counsel of God;&rdquo; they
resemble the characters of flame upon the walls of the palace of
Belshazzar, which announced the terrible
decree,&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Thou art weighed in the
balances</span>, <span class="smcap">and art found
wanting</span>.&rdquo; <a name="citation28b"></a><a
href="#footnote28b" class="citation">[28b]</a></p>
<p>The Christian writer, judging from the experience of the past,
cannot close his eyes to the sad truth, that there are some whom
mercy softens not, whom threatening warns not, whom danger alarms
not.&nbsp; Who amidst manifestations of Divine wrath, display
hardened unconcern or desperate wickedness.&nbsp; What a striking
proof have we here of the effects of sin in hardening the heart,
and <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>deadening the conscience.&nbsp; But let not any imagine
that such men will view the approach of the fatal malady without
alarm.&nbsp; The bodily anguish will probably supply no parallel
to the mental terror, when they find themselves clutched, as it
were, in the grasp of the mortal disease which is destroying
them.&nbsp; And in the ordinarily brief interval between seizure
and that death, which so often ensues, if conscience resume her
power, how terrible must be the remorse, how unutterable the
anguish of the affrighted soul, which sees death, death eternal
in view, and yet cannot pray: or if the cry for pardon and help
to their long-forgotten God, burst from the quivering lip, it is
the bitter cry of almost despairing terror.&nbsp; Sad as are many
of the scenes which human life presents in its passage from the
cradle to the tomb; and harrowing to the feelings of beholders as
is the sight of corporeal anguish; how immeasurably do other
scenes of human suffering fall short of the union of bodily and
mental agony, often witnessed on the death-bed of terrified
guilt! but still, to the religious mind, there are two death-beds
still more fearful, as being more hopeless; and they are, when
desperate wickedness, at its last hour, evinces hardened
indifference or blasphemous despair; when no prayer is offered,
or when curses are mingled with the prayer.</p>
<p>May the fear of such death-beds act, through the grace of God,
as a salutary warning to those <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>who are living in sin, and neglecting
to improve the call to repentance sent in mercy: and let their
thoughts extend beyond the present life, and draw further
instruction from the awful truth&mdash;that whilst death
terminates to impenitent guilt its present sufferings, it
commences others far more terrible.</p>
<p>Were it permitted to a living man to pass the portals of the
dark prison-house of disembodied spirits, and witness the
punishments of the condemned,&mdash;the unceasing gnawing of the
undying worm, the unremitting burning of the unquenched
fire;&mdash;what words could express the joy and thankfulness of
that man, on returning to the land of the living and the place of
hope!&nbsp; Would he lose a moment in fleeing to the cross of
Christ, for deliverance from sin, and refuge from the wrath to
come?&nbsp; Would he still defer seeking for &ldquo;repentance
towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ?&rdquo; <a
name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a>&nbsp; The terrible realities he had
witnessed of that state of untried being on which the soul enters
at death, would doubtless haunt his waking and his sleeping
hours, and he would find no rest till God, by his Spirit, had
spoken peace to his affrighted soul.&nbsp; And then, long as life
lasted, it would be his daily subject of grateful thanksgiving to
his gracious long-suffering Lord, that he had borne <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>with his
iniquities, and had not cut him off in the midst of his sins: but
through the Divine mercy he was allowed on earth &ldquo;to praise
the Lord with joyful lips,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;in hell,
lifting up his eyes, being in torments.&rdquo; <a
name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a></p>
<p>But such a visit to the place of condemned spirits is not
necessary to learn all that in our present state of being it
concerns us to know.&nbsp; The volume of inspiration has revealed
the awful truth, that an eternity of torments awaits the
condemned in a future world.</p>
<p>Will not, then, this suffice to rouse thoughtless and sinful
men to a sense of danger?&nbsp; The judgments of the Almighty now
upon the land; death approaching many under a fearful form; the
presumption and sinfulness of trusting to a late repentance; the
danger of the infliction of judicial blindness; the horrors of a
guilty death-bed; the torments of the damned, have all been urged
as so many calls to repentance, and may God accompany them with
his grace, that they may not be urged in vain; but all of these
equal not the awfulness and terribleness of <span
class="smcap">an eternity of torment</span>.&nbsp; There is
something overpowering in the idea of unmitigated unmitigable
woe; it is so terrific, that it astounds, it is so vast, that it
overwhelms the mind: for the finite faculties of man cannot grasp
eternity: they <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>are lost in the maze of millions of years rolling on in
endless succession.&nbsp; But if there be any who have tost, for
one night, on a bed of suffering; any who have experienced, for
one hour, the racking torture of intolerable pain; let them ask
themselves how they would endure, in the immensity of endless
time, &ldquo;the worm which dieth not, and the fire which is not
quenched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May this awful consideration have its due weight upon every
reader; may those who have not yet been &ldquo;turned from
darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God,&rdquo;
obtain grace to seek pardon and peace through the Saviour who
brought life and immortality to light by the Gospel; that,
through Him they may escape &ldquo;the fire prepared for the
devil and his angels.&rdquo; <a name="citation32a"></a><a
href="#footnote32a" class="citation">[32a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Knowing, therefore, the terrors of the Lord, we
persuade men,&rdquo; <a name="citation32b"></a><a
href="#footnote32b" class="citation">[32b]</a> says St. Paul: who
afterwards adds, &ldquo;Now, then, we are ambassadors for Christ;
as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you, in
Christ&rsquo;s stead, be ye reconciled unto God.&rdquo; <a
name="citation32c"></a><a href="#footnote32c"
class="citation">[32c]</a>&nbsp; It is thus the Christian
minister declares the denunciations of Divine vengeance, and the
certainty and eternity of Divine punishments, that he may prepare
the way for a joyful acceptance of the offers of Divine
mercy.&nbsp; This two-fold duty of the ministerial office, is
beautifully described by Cowper:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>&ldquo;There stands the messenger of truth, there
stands<br />
The legate of the skies!&nbsp; His theme divine,<br />
His office sacred, his credentials clear.<br />
By him the violated Law speaks out<br />
Its thunders: and by him, in strains as sweet<br />
As angels use, the Gospel whispers peace.&rdquo; <a
name="citation33a"></a><a href="#footnote33a"
class="citation">[33a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dispensations of the Almighty are at once the inflictions
of his displeasure, the warnings of his love, and the invitations
of his mercy: to every sinner they address the enquiry,
&ldquo;Despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and
forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of
God leadeth thee to repentance?&nbsp; But after thy hardness and
impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day
of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God?&rdquo;
<a name="citation33b"></a><a href="#footnote33b"
class="citation">[33b]</a>&nbsp; May the Almighty give his
blessing upon the afflictive visitation He has sent upon this
land, that sinners may be roused to a sense of their danger, and
brought to embrace thankfully the offers of pardon and salvation,
made through Christ Jesus our Lord!</p>
<p>The Holy Scriptures present at once the most earnest calls to
repentance and the most gracious offers of forgiveness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the
death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and
live: turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways, for why will <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>ye die, O
house of Israel?&rdquo; <a name="citation34a"></a><a
href="#footnote34a" class="citation">[34a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;O
house of Israel, are not my ways equal, and are not your ways
unequal? saith the Lord.&nbsp; Therefore I will judge you, O
house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord
God.&nbsp; Repent, and turn yourselves from all your
transgressions, so iniquity shall not be your ruin.&nbsp; Cast
away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have
transgressed, and make you a new heart, and a new spirit; for why
will ye die, O house of Israel? for I have no pleasure in the
death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God.&nbsp; Wherefore,
turn yourselves, and live ye.&rdquo; <a name="citation34b"></a><a
href="#footnote34b" class="citation">[34b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins
be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red
like crimson, they shall be as wool.&rdquo; <a
name="citation34c"></a><a href="#footnote34c"
class="citation">[34c]</a></p>
<p>Such are some of the invitations of the Holy Scriptures to
turning and calling upon God.&nbsp; Let us, then, suppose the
case of one who is alarmed by the Divine threatenings; who,
conscious of his guilt, sees as it were the gulf of perdition
yawning beneath his feet; but is deterred, by a sense of the
heinousness of his sins, from seeking the pardon which he
despairs of obtaining.&nbsp; How is he to be addressed?&nbsp; The
love and mercy of God, as shewn towards a guilty and perishing
world, in the mysterious, but most gracious, plan of redemption,
<a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>through
the Saviour, must be pointed out, and largely dwelt upon.&nbsp;
Under the severer dispensation of the Law, amid the awful
splendours of its promulgation, the Lord was proclaimed to be
&ldquo;the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious,
long-suffering, abundant in goodness and truth; keeping mercy for
thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin, and that
will by no means clear the guilty.&rdquo; <a
name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a"
class="citation">[35a]</a>&nbsp; Under the Gospel dispensation,
it is emphatically said, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">God is
love</span>:&rdquo; <a name="citation35b"></a><a
href="#footnote35b" class="citation">[35b]</a> that &ldquo;God so
loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have
everlasting life.&rdquo; <a name="citation35c"></a><a
href="#footnote35c" class="citation">[35c]</a>&nbsp; Let not,
therefore, the heinousness of past sins, and the sense of present
unworthiness, deter any from coming to the Saviour: for
&ldquo;God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world,
but that the world through Him might be saved.&rdquo; <a
name="citation35d"></a><a href="#footnote35d"
class="citation">[35d]</a>&nbsp; And that gracious Saviour has
authoritatively declared, what is the sole condition of
acceptance, through His infinite merits: &ldquo;Verily, Verily, I
say unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlasting
life:&rdquo; <a name="citation35e"></a><a href="#footnote35e"
class="citation">[35e]</a> and has tenderly invited all to flee
unto Him who labour under the yoke of sin, or the burden of
sorrow; &ldquo;Come unto me, all ye that labour and are
heavy-laden, and I will give you rest: take my yoke upon you, and
learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>heart; and ye
shall find rest unto your souls: for my yoke is easy, and my
burden is light.&rdquo; <a name="citation36a"></a><a
href="#footnote36a" class="citation">[36a]</a>&nbsp; Before the
nativity of our blessed Lord, the command was conveyed by an
angel, &ldquo;Thou shalt call His name Jesus, for He shall save
His people from their sins.&rdquo; <a name="citation36b"></a><a
href="#footnote36b" class="citation">[36b]</a>&nbsp; Agreeably to
which, He Himself says, &ldquo;I am not come to call the
righteous, but sinners to repentance.&rdquo; <a
name="citation36c"></a><a href="#footnote36c"
class="citation">[36c]</a>&nbsp; And St. Paul prefaces his
delivery of the great truth he was commissioned to teach, in a
manner befitting its importance: &ldquo;This is a true saying,
and worthy of all men to be received, that Christ Jesus came into
the world to save sinners.&rdquo; <a name="citation36d"></a><a
href="#footnote36d" class="citation">[36d]</a>&nbsp; If the
Gospel did not contain a free pardon for sin, little would it be
in accordance either with its name, <i>good news</i>, or with the
proclamation of the heavenly host, which heralded the birth of
the Messiah: &ldquo;Behold, I bring you good tidings of great
joy, which shall be <i>to all people</i>, for unto you is born
this day in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the
Lord.&rdquo; <a name="citation36e"></a><a href="#footnote36e"
class="citation">[36e]</a>&nbsp; To every penitent the promise is
addressed&mdash;&ldquo;Him that cometh to Me, I will in no wise
cast out.&rdquo; <a name="citation36f"></a><a href="#footnote36f"
class="citation">[36f]</a>&nbsp; The Divine mercy towards
repentant sinners knows no restrictions; the cleansing power of
the Saviour&rsquo;s blood, no limitations.</p>
<p>If there be any self-convicted and self-condemned sinner,
still hesitating to throw himself <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>upon the mercy of God in Christ, let
him hear the Psalmist, who has represented under the most
striking and affecting images, the love of God towards man:
&ldquo;The Lord is full of compassion and mercy; long-suffering
and of great goodness.&nbsp; He will not always be chiding,
neither keepeth He his anger for ever.&nbsp; He hath not dealt
with us after our sins, nor rewarded us according to our
wickednesses.&nbsp; For look how high the heaven is in comparison
of the earth, so great is His mercy also toward them that fear
Him.&nbsp; Look how wide also the east is from the west, so far
hath He set our sins from Him.&nbsp; <i>Yea</i>, <i>like as a
father pitieth his own children</i>, <i>even so is the Lord
merciful unto them who fear Him</i>.&nbsp; For He knoweth whereof
we are made, He remembereth that we are but dust.&rdquo; <a
name="citation37a"></a><a href="#footnote37a"
class="citation">[37a]</a>&nbsp; Let him hear St. John, who has
stated the full extent of Christ&rsquo;s atoning and mediatorial
power: &ldquo;If <i>any man sin</i>, we have an advocate with the
Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and He is the propitiation
for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the
whole world.&rdquo; <a name="citation37b"></a><a
href="#footnote37b" class="citation">[37b]</a>&nbsp; Let him hear
St. Paul, who has supplied a sure ground of unfailing trust in
God: &ldquo;<i>He that spared not His own Son</i>, but delivered
Him up for us all, how <i>shall He not with Him also freely give
us all things</i>?&rdquo; <a name="citation37c"></a><a
href="#footnote37c" class="citation">[37c]</a>&nbsp; Should any
one still hesitate <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>to come unto Christ as their Saviour, let him hear His
merciful expostulation, &ldquo;<i>Ye will not come to me that ye
might have life</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation38a"></a><a
href="#footnote38a" class="citation">[38a]</a>&nbsp; Let him
listen to His gracious enquiry, &ldquo;<i>Wilt thou be made
whole</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; And if he still cannot persuade himself,
that there is mercy in store for such a sinner as himself, let
him at last draw comfort from the assurance, that &ldquo;the
<i>Son of Man is come to save that which is lost</i>,&rdquo; <a
name="citation38b"></a><a href="#footnote38b"
class="citation">[38b]</a> and seeks after perishing sinners, as
the faithful shepherd after the sheep which have wandered from
the fold.&nbsp; Nor is this all: not only does our gracious Lord
<i>seek after guilty and lost sinners</i>, but &ldquo;<i>likewise
there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over</i> <span
class="smcap">one sinner</span> <i>that repenteth</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation38c"></a><a href="#footnote38c"
class="citation">[38c]</a>&nbsp; What a proof have we here of the
value of the soul in the sight of God!&nbsp; His incarnate Son
dying to redeem it from eternal misery; when restored to His
Father&rsquo;s right hand, watching over it with constant care;
and seeking, with tender gentleness, to bring back the wanderers
from the fold of grace: and when the slave of sin breaks his
fetters, and through grace given unto him, falls repentant and
humbled at the foot of the cross, then joy is felt in the court
of heaven, and the seraphic choir give praise, and honour, and
glory, to &ldquo;Him who sitteth on the throne, and the
Lamb;&rdquo; <a name="citation38d"></a><a href="#footnote38d"
class="citation">[38d]</a> because a poor sinner has been turned,
by the marvellous <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>grace of the Gospel, &ldquo;from darkness to light, and
from the power of Satan unto God; that he may receive forgiveness
of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith
that is in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; <a name="citation39a"></a><a
href="#footnote39a" class="citation">[39a]</a></p>
<p>The gracious and unmerited invitations of Divine mercy are
addressed to all sinners by &ldquo;God our Saviour, who will have
all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the
truth.&rdquo; <a name="citation39b"></a><a href="#footnote39b"
class="citation">[39b]</a>&nbsp; Let not therefore any one say,
my sins are too great to be forgiven; this is to limit the
atoning efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s blood, which is illimitable:
let not any one say, I am not yet fit to come unto Christ; this
is to mistake the nature of the Gospel, which is designed to
remedy man&rsquo;s natural unfitness: but let all betake
themselves to Christ for pardon of past sins, through His blood;
and for strength against future temptations, through His
grace.&nbsp; Nor let it be thought that these observations apply
only to gross sinners.&nbsp; One description of man&rsquo;s
natural condition, and only one, applies to the whole human
race;&mdash;&ldquo;All have sinned and come short of the glory of
God:&rdquo; and one means of restoration to the lost favour of
God, and only one, is offered to the whole human race;&mdash;the
&ldquo;being justified freely by His grace, through the
redemption that is in Jesus Christ: whom God has set forth to be
a propitiation, <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness
for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance
of God.&rdquo; <a name="citation40a"></a><a href="#footnote40a"
class="citation">[40a]</a>&nbsp; Those who refuse to come unto
Christ as sinners, stand self-excluded from all benefit of His
atonement.&nbsp; To such the Saviour addresses the
words,&mdash;&ldquo;Because thou sayest I am rich, and increased
with goods, and have need of nothing; and <i>knowest not that
thou art wretched</i>, <i>and miserable</i>, <i>and poor</i>,
<i>and blind</i>, <i>and naked</i>.&nbsp; <i>I counsel thee to
buy of</i> <span class="smcap">me</span> gold tried in the fire,
that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment that thou mayest be
clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and
anoint thine eyes with eye-salve that thou mayest see.&rdquo; <a
name="citation40b"></a><a href="#footnote40b"
class="citation">[40b]</a>&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s natural weakness and
sinfulness is the fundamental truth on which the Christian plan
of redemption is built; for if he had possessed inherent power to
overcome his natural depravity, and keep the commandments of God,
the sacrifice of Christ would not have been necessary for the
atonement of his sins, and for his escape from eternal
condemnation.&nbsp; Did we not know that pride, based upon a poor
and defective system of morality, generally shows the most
decided hostility to the humbling doctrines of the Gospel, it
would hardly be believed that any would refuse to come to Christ
as sinners.&nbsp; How much at variance are such self-righteous
feelings with the <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>spirit of the confession of our Church, in which, under
the appropriate and affecting figure of sheep wandered from the
fold, we are accustomed to entreat the pity, protection, and
guidance, of the great &ldquo;Shepherd of our souls.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There are two considerations, however, which may, with the Divine
blessing, if duly weighed, bring such persons to the foot of the
cross with deep self-abasement and acknowledgment of sin: one is,
that in the Gospel the motive determines the value of an action;
and the Christian&rsquo;s motive is, to do all to the glory of
God: the other is, that man is accountable, not only for his
actions, but for his omissions; not only for every idle word, but
for every sinful wish; nay, more, for every impure thought
indulged and cherished.&nbsp; Let those who think their failings
few and venial, their merits great, and deserving of reward,
apply to their lives these two great tests of Christian
holiness&mdash;praying, at the same time, to &ldquo;the Father of
lights,&rdquo; for grace and knowledge: and if they be not
brought to admit, that &ldquo;in many things we offend
all;&rdquo; <a name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a> if it be not the language of their
hearts, &ldquo;We acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins and
wickedness, which we, from time to time, most grievously have
committed, by thought, word, and deed, against thy Divine
Majesty, provoking most justly thy wrath and indignation <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>against
us;&rdquo;&mdash;they are ignorant of the spirit of the Gospel,
and far from the kingdom of God.&nbsp; For, like the Jews of old,
&ldquo;they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge:
for they, being ignorant of God&rsquo;s righteousness, and going
about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted
themselves unto the righteousness of God.&nbsp; <i>For Christ is
the end of the law for righteousness to every one that
believeth</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation42a"></a><a
href="#footnote42a" class="citation">[42a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;That
no flesh should glory in His presence.&nbsp; But of Him are ye in
Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and
righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption; that,
according as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in
the Lord.&rdquo; <a name="citation42b"></a><a href="#footnote42b"
class="citation">[42b]</a></p>
<p>To true believers, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Christ is all in
all</span>:&rdquo; <a name="citation42c"></a><a
href="#footnote42c" class="citation">[42c]</a> on His atonement
they rest for pardon before God; on His grace they rely for
strength; and to His merits they trust for salvation.&nbsp; Their
truly Christian hope is built upon a lively faith; they believe
&ldquo;that man is very far gone from original righteousness, and
is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth
always contrary to the spirit, and therefore in every person born
into this world, it deserveth God&rsquo;s wrath and
damnation.&rdquo; <a name="citation42d"></a><a
href="#footnote42d" class="citation">[42d]</a>&nbsp; That
&ldquo;the condition of man, after the fall of Adam, is such,
that he cannot turn and prepare himself, by <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>his own
natural strength and good works, to faith and calling upon God;
wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasant and
acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing
us, that we may have a good will, and working with us when we
have that good will.&rdquo; <a name="citation43a"></a><a
href="#footnote43a" class="citation">[43a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;That
we are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by faith, and not for our own works
and deservings: wherefore that we are justified by faith only, is
a most wholesome doctrine, and very full of comfort.&rdquo; <a
name="citation43b"></a><a href="#footnote43b"
class="citation">[43b]</a>&nbsp; And &ldquo;albeit that good
works, which are the fruits of faith, and follow after
justification, cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity
of God&rsquo;s judgments; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to
God in Christ, and do spring out necessarily of a true and lively
faith; insomuch that by them a lively faith may be as evidently
known as a tree discerned by the fruit.&rdquo; <a
name="citation43c"></a><a href="#footnote43c"
class="citation">[43c]</a></p>
<p>Such are the four Articles of the Church of England which
declare man&rsquo;s natural corruption; his just exposure to
Divine condemnation; his means of restoration to God&rsquo;s
favour; the meritorious cause of his salvation; and the
inseparable union of faith and good works.&nbsp; From which may
be drawn these two fundamental principles of the Christian
faith&mdash;salvation, alone through the all-sufficient <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>merits of
Christ; and sanctification, alone through the renewing power of
the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Man is, in every respect, a dependent
being: the same Almighty Power which formed his body from the
dust of the earth, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of
life; can alone enlighten, renew, and sanctify his soul.&nbsp;
Thus faith&mdash;which is the rock on which the Church of Christ
is built, and without which we shall never believe the promises,
accept the offers, or attain the salvation of the Gospel&mdash;is
the gift of God, and wrought in our souls by the Holy
Spirit.&nbsp; United with faith is true repentance, which is no
less the work of grace; for unless God enlighten the
understanding, there will be no just sense of sin; unless He
soften the heart, there will be no contrition: and from a true
repentance there always springs holy obedience, which is also
produced by the Spirit: for the same blessed Power which
enlightens the darkness of the understanding and softens the
hardness of the heart, also rectifies the perversion of the will,
and sanctifies the corruption of the affections, that the
believer may know, choose, obey, and love, the way of
godliness.&nbsp; And thus we arrive at that blessed change in the
life of a penitent, when he becomes &ldquo;a new creature in
Christ Jesus,&rdquo; when &ldquo;old things have passed away, and
behold all things have become new;&rdquo; when he has &ldquo;put
on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and
true holiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>The
renewal and sanctification of the soul is the only sure ground on
which the Christian can build his unfailing hope of
salvation.&nbsp; Not that any may presume to limit the extent of
the Divine mercy, or state a definite time for the operations of
the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; The first is as boundless as it is
unsearchable; the second may be as instantaneous as it is
incomprehensible.&nbsp; Thus much we know with certainty, that
when that most encouraging call to repentance was addressed to
the Jewish people,&mdash;&ldquo;Let the wicked forsake his way,
and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the
Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He
will abundantly pardon;&rdquo;&mdash;there was added, &ldquo;For
my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,
saith the Lord: for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so
are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your
thoughts.&rdquo; <a name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a>&nbsp; Still, all who have time and
opportunity must prove the sincerity of their repentance, and the
soundness of their faith by the holiness of their practice.&nbsp;
Nor can it be too earnestly insisted upon, that it is only by the
gift of a new and holier nature, man can rise above the pleasures
of sense and things of time, and set his affections on the joys
of immortality; and that the new and holier nature is implanted,
when the gracious promise is fulfilled&mdash;&ldquo;I will give
them one <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>heart, and <i>I will put a new spirit within you</i>;
<i>and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh</i>, and
will give them an heart of flesh: that they may walk in my
statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall
be my people, and I will be their God.&rdquo; <a
name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a"
class="citation">[46a]</a>&nbsp; It is to the use of palliatives
much of the insincere repentance and imperfect reformation of men
is to be ascribed.&nbsp; When their fears are alarmed, they set
about correcting some flagrant sins, and it may be, become
outwardly moral, and even attentive to religious duties; but the
renewal of the heart, through grace, and the dedication of its
affections to God, are never thought of; and yet they are
satisfied with this condition.&nbsp; Such persons are only to be
roused by preaching conversion or condemnation.&nbsp; They must
be taught to pray, with repentant David, &ldquo;<i>Make me a
clean heart</i>, <i>O God</i>, <i>and renew a right spirit within
me</i>.&nbsp; Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not
thy Holy Spirit from me.&nbsp; O give me the comfort of thy help
again, and stablish me with thy free Spirit.&rdquo; <a
name="citation46b"></a><a href="#footnote46b"
class="citation">[46b]</a></p>
<p>The great work of the renewal and sanctification of the soul
is ordinarily accomplished by a progressive growth in grace;
during which, the believer is gradually enabled to obtain the
mastery over the corrupt affections of his nature, to acquire the
graces and perform the duties of the Christian character, and
&ldquo;to set his affections on things <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>above,&rdquo; ever &ldquo;pressing
toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in
Christ Jesus,&rdquo; <a name="citation47a"></a><a
href="#footnote47a" class="citation">[47a]</a> and endeavouring
to &ldquo;come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of
the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the
stature of the fulness of Christ.&rdquo; <a
name="citation47b"></a><a href="#footnote47b"
class="citation">[47b]</a>&nbsp; In the life of some of those who
have been &ldquo;brought up in the nurture and admonition of the
Lord,&rdquo; <a name="citation47c"></a><a href="#footnote47c"
class="citation">[47c]</a> and have never departed from serving
their God, there may be no clearly defined transitions, no
strongly-marked shades, in the harmoniously-blended colours, in
which has been traced the even tenor of their way.&nbsp; But such
cases are probably rare&mdash;for those who attain to a very high
degree of spiritual-mindedness, can generally fix upon some
definite period in their religious life, when they obtained
clearer views of their personal unworthiness, and of the holiness
of God&rsquo;s law; of the insufficiency of the things of earth
to minister to the wants of an immortal soul; and of the
inestimable value of the &ldquo;treasure in heaven,&rdquo; than
they ever possessed before; and when they learnt to rely on their
Lord more confidently, to love Him more devotedly, to advance His
cause more zealously, and to obey Him more steadily and
implicitly.&nbsp; In the case of those, who have either deserted
the God of their youth for a &ldquo;world lying in
wickedness,&rdquo; but, like the prodigal, upon abandoning its
vices and follies, have been received and pardoned by a merciful
Father; or <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>who have been brought up in ignorance of religion, but
have been plucked like a brand from the burning, by one of those
afflictive dispensations which God often sends in mercy to awaken
sinners; the time and circumstances of their conversion <a
name="citation48a"></a><a href="#footnote48a"
class="citation">[48a]</a> will be clearly marked and ever
remembered: &ldquo;it is too momentous an event,&rdquo; observes
Paley, in writing of such conversions, &ldquo;to be forgot: a man
might as easily forget his escape from a shipwreck.&rdquo; <a
name="citation48b"></a><a href="#footnote48b"
class="citation">[48b]</a></p>
<p>The knowledge of the time, however, when conversion takes
place, is principally of importance, as far as it goes to
establish the fact, the certainty of which must always be
determined by the effects produced; for it is easy in this, as in
every other particular of religious experience, to be
deceived.&nbsp; But there can be no deception when the believer
is at once conscious of a change in his heart, and exhibits a
reformation in his life; for then he may say, this I know, that
whereas I was dead, now am I alive in the Lord: he possesses an
internal witness to his being born of God;&mdash;&ldquo;Whosoever
believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God;&rdquo;
&ldquo;He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>witness&mdash;in himself;&rdquo; and His life affords
external proof of his sonship;&mdash;&ldquo;Whosoever is born of
God, sinneth not.&rdquo; <a name="citation49a"></a><a
href="#footnote49a" class="citation">[49a]</a>&nbsp; He rejoices,
therefore, in the glorious privileges of the Gospel, through
which &ldquo;there is, therefore, now no condemnation to them
which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh but after
the Spirit;&rdquo; through which, &ldquo;as many as are led by
the Spirit of God, are the sons of God;&rdquo; <a
name="citation49b"></a><a href="#footnote49b"
class="citation">[49b]</a> and through which, &ldquo;the Spirit
itself beareth witness with our spirits, that we are the children
of God; and if children, then heirs of God, and joint heirs with
Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let, then, the reformed examine strictly into their lives, as
to whether they exhibit decisive proofs of a genuine conversion;
of conversion, not used in its limited sense, as implying a
sudden or even violent change, but in the more extended sense, of
a recovery from sin, and of a full development of the Christian
character:&mdash;a conversion which, in its completion, is
equivalent to the renewal of the soul in righteousness; the
progress of which may be, in some, so gradual, as almost to be
imperceptible, but must be, in all, so certain, as to be
unquestionable.&nbsp; Let those, who, through the grace of God,
have endeavoured to live ever mindful of their baptismal
engagements, and duly sensible of the blessed privileges of the
Christian <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>covenant, institute a no less rigid examination into
their lives, as to how far they manifest a continued growth in
grace; an increasing in every good word and work; a growing
conformity to the example of Christ; a visible ripening for
heaven; and a gradual restoration of the lost image of God in the
soul.&nbsp; And what is to be said to those who have either never
learnt, or have wilfully violated, their baptismal engagements;
and during a long course of sin, have neglected, disobeyed, and
forgotten God, whose calls to repentance they still
disregard?&nbsp; The same language must be addressed to the
habitual, as was applied to the externally reformed
sinner;&mdash;whose heart was still the seat of vain or impure
desires, of base or malignant passions;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">conversion</span> or <span
class="smcap">condemnation</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of the persons in
our congregations,&rdquo; says Paley, &ldquo;to whom we not only
may, but must, preach the doctrine of conversion, plainly and
directly, are those, who with the name indeed of Christians, have
hitherto passed their lives without any internal religion
whatever; who have not at all thought upon the subject; who, a
few easy and customary forms excepted (and which with them are
mere forms), cannot truly say of themselves, that they have done
one action, which they would not have done equally, if there had
been no such thing as a God in the world; or that they have ever
sacrificed any passion, any present enjoyment, <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>or even any
inclination of their minds to the restraints and prohibitions of
religion; with whom, indeed, religious motives have not weighed a
feather in the scale against interest or pleasure.&nbsp; To these
it is utterly necessary that we preach conversion.&rdquo; <a
name="citation51a"></a><a href="#footnote51a"
class="citation">[51a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;The next description of
persons to whom we must preach conversion, properly so called,
are those who allow themselves in the course and habit of some
particular sin, with more or less regularity in other articles of
behaviour; there is some particular sin, which they practise
constantly and habitually, and allow themselves in that
practice.&nbsp; Other sins they strive against, but in this they
allow themselves.&nbsp; Now no man can go on in this course
consistently with the hope of salvation; therefore, it must be
broken off.&nbsp; The essential and precise difference between a
child of God and another is, that the true child of God <i>allows
himself</i> in no sin whatever; cost what it may, he contends
against, he combats all sin; which he certainly cannot be said to
do, who is still in the course and habit of some particular sin;
for as to that sin, he reserves it, he compromises it.&nbsp; Here
then we must preach conversion.&rdquo; <a
name="citation51b"></a><a href="#footnote51b"
class="citation">[51b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;In these two cases,
therefore, men must be converted and live, or remain unconverted
and die.&rdquo; <a name="citation51c"></a><a href="#footnote51c"
class="citation">[51c]</a></p>
<p>Let then all those who are living in ignorance of <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>the spirit,
and consequently in neglect of the obligations of the Gospel, lay
this to heart; and let them not imagine that it is only intended
to alarm their fears.&nbsp; The scoffer, the profane, the
sceptic, and the infidel, can hope for nothing through a Gospel
which they ridicule, despise, or reject.&nbsp; But the gay, the
thoughtless, and the proud&mdash;the worldly, the avaricious, and
the sensual&mdash;the malicious, the censorious, and the
envious&mdash;all profess to believe the Gospel; and the
lukewarm, the self-righteous, and hypocritical, pretend to make
it their rule of life.&nbsp; &ldquo;To the law, and to the
testimony,&rdquo; to see whether these must all be converted or
condemned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not every one that saith unto me, Lord,
Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth
the will of my Father which is in heaven.&nbsp; Many will say
unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy
name, and in Thy name have cast out devils, and in Thy name done
many wonderful works?&nbsp; And then will I profess unto them, I
never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.&rdquo; <a
name="citation52a"></a><a href="#footnote52a"
class="citation">[52a]</a>&nbsp; It appears, therefore, possible
to exercise some of the highest functions of Christianity, and
yet to be cast away.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not the hearers of the law are
just before God, but the doers of the law shall be
justified.&rdquo; <a name="citation52b"></a><a
href="#footnote52b" class="citation">[52b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Be ye
doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own
selves.&rdquo; <a name="citation52c"></a><a href="#footnote52c"
class="citation">[52c]</a>&nbsp; Hence, then, <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>we learn the
worthlessness of a mere profession of the Gospel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Love not the world, neither the things that are in the
world: if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not
in him.&rdquo; <a name="citation53a"></a><a href="#footnote53a"
class="citation">[53a]</a>&nbsp; Here we are taught the
incompatibility of the love of the world with the love of
God.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which
are these;&mdash;adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,
emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings,
murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I
tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they
which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.&rdquo;
<a name="citation53b"></a><a href="#footnote53b"
class="citation">[53b]</a>&nbsp; This fearful catalogue of
offences, which exclude from heaven, passes sentence of
condemnation upon all who live in the indulgence of any known
sin.&nbsp; From these, and many other passages of Scripture, as
well as from its general tenor, we arrive at the conclusion, that
the various classes of men which have been described, are all
exposed to the righteous judgment of God, ready to be revealed at
the last day.&nbsp; They bear the Christian name, it is true, but
that is all they possess of a blessed dispensation, which was
ushered in by the preaching of repentance:&mdash;&ldquo;The time
is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand, <i>repent ye and
believe the Gospel</i>;&rdquo; <a name="citation53c"></a><a
href="#footnote53c" class="citation">[53c]</a> and which has
always imposed upon its converts personal holiness, <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>as a
universal obligation, and inseparable from its promises and
rewards; &ldquo;<i>Wherefore follow holiness</i>, <i>without
which no man shall see the Lord</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation54a"></a><a href="#footnote54a"
class="citation">[54a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;For the grace of God that
bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that
denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that
blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our
Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave Himself for us, that He might
redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar
people, zealous of good works.&rdquo; <a
name="citation54b"></a><a href="#footnote54b"
class="citation">[54b]</a>&nbsp; As being destitute, therefore,
of the essentials of the Christian faith, the powerful writer,
who has already been quoted at such great length, says,
&ldquo;these persons are really in as unconverted a state as any
Jew or Gentile could be in our Saviour&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; They
are no more Christians, as to any actual benefit of Christianity
to their souls, than the most hardened Jew, or the most
profligate Gentile, was in the age of the Gospel.&nbsp; As to any
difference in the two cases, the difference is all against
them.&nbsp; These must be converted before they can be
saved.&nbsp; The course of their thoughts must be changed: the
very principles upon which they act must be changed.&nbsp;
Considerations which never, or hardly ever, entered into their
minds, <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>must deeply and perpetually engage them.&nbsp; Views and
motives, which did not influence them at all, either as checks
from doing evil, or as inducements to do good, must become the
views and motives which they regularly consult, and by which they
are guided;&mdash;that is to say, there must be a revolution of
principle: the visible conduct will follow the change, but there
must be a revolution within.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These observations are made by Paley, with reference to those
persons &ldquo;who have hitherto passed their lives without any
internal religion whatever;&rdquo; with whom, in short, religion
has not been the rule of life.&nbsp; Oh! that the countless
multitudes within this kingdom, to whom this description applies,
and who are living regardless, if not ignorant, of the eternal
condemnation impending over their unconverted souls, &ldquo;would
be wise and consider their latter end.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh that they
would be persuaded to learn from the word of God, what the holy
name which they bear requires of them; and consider what the vows
made in baptism bind them to, if they wish to be partakers of the
precious benefits purchased for his faithful servants by Christ,
at the costly price of his blood.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye do err, not
knowing the Scriptures,&rdquo; is a reproof which applies to them
all.&nbsp; For, unfortunately, the generality of men are content
to receive from others all they know of religion: they do not
enquire for themselves; but willingly acquiesce in the most
indulgent views of <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>human duty.&nbsp; And if they do sometimes read the
Bible, yet they do not study it, and pray over it, with an
anxious desire to be brought to a knowledge of the truth; with a
firm determination to receive the truth, however unpleasant,
however opposed to their present opinions; and with a resolution,
not suddenly taken, but after mature and anxious deliberation,
and not formed in dependence upon themselves, but upon Divine
grace, to build their faith and practice on its holy doctrines
and precepts.&nbsp; To all such, however, we would say,
&ldquo;This do, and ye shall live:&rdquo; let the time past of
your lives suffice to have past in ignorance or neglect of
God&rsquo;s gracious revelation to man; now delay not longer:
&ldquo;The night is far spent, the day is at hand;&rdquo; may the
day-spring from on high visit you, and the day-star arise in your
hearts to give light to you, who, whilst the beams of the Sun of
Righteousness are shining around you, are still lying in darkness
and the shadow of death.&nbsp; &ldquo;Search the
Scriptures,&rdquo; and learn from them, and not from the opinions
and conduct of men, what is the hope of the Christian calling;
search the Scriptures, and from them learn, that ye must repent
or die eternally.</p>
<p>May the profane, the scoffer, and the sceptic, have the veil
of darkness removed from their understandings, by which
&ldquo;the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which
believe not, lest <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the
image of God, should shine unto them.&rdquo; <a
name="citation57a"></a><a href="#footnote57a"
class="citation">[57a]</a>&nbsp; May they not be left in wilful
blindness, until that terrible day, when the enemies of the Lord
shall find, to their everlasting confusion, that &ldquo;the wrath
of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and
unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;
because that which is known of God is manifest in them; for God
hath shewed it unto them.&nbsp; For the invisible things of Him
from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being
understood by the things that are made, <i>even His eternal power
and Godhead</i>: so that they are without excuse: because that,
when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were
thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their
foolish heart was darkened: professing themselves to be wise,
they became fools.&rdquo;&nbsp; May</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;The gay, licentious, proud,<br />
Whom pleasure, power, and affluence surround,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>learn &ldquo;how hardly shall they who have riches enter into
the kingdom of God!&rdquo; <a name="citation57b"></a><a
href="#footnote57b" class="citation">[57b]</a>&nbsp; For they too
often forget they are God&rsquo;s stewards, and accountable for
all they possess.&nbsp; The day will come when to all of them
will be addressed the command, &ldquo;Give an <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>account of
thy stewardship;&rdquo; and how terrible will be their lot,
should they, &ldquo;having been unfaithful in the unrighteous
mammon,&rdquo; lose &ldquo;the true riches,&rdquo;&mdash;treasure
in heaven.&nbsp; Our Lord himself has said, &ldquo;No servant can
serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the
other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the
other.&nbsp; Ye cannot serve God and mammon.&rdquo; <a
name="citation58a"></a><a href="#footnote58a"
class="citation">[58a]</a>&nbsp; They, therefore, who in their
day of trial have forgotten that their rank or affluence are so
many talents, for which they are to give account to their Master
in heaven, must expect fearful retribution, unless, while the day
of grace remaineth, they obtain pardon and peace through their
long-neglected Lord.&nbsp; Let them now learn that the friendship
of the world&mdash;whose smile they have courted, whose honours
they have coveted, whose pleasures they have
enjoyed&mdash;&ldquo;is enmity with God.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For
all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of
the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of
the world.&nbsp; And the world passeth away, and the lust
thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for
ever.&rdquo; <a name="citation58b"></a><a href="#footnote58b"
class="citation">[58b]</a>&nbsp; May the avaricious and the
sensual, whose grovelling, sordid, and impure minds, have not a
thought, a wish, beyond this earth, where they would willingly
live for ever; see their sin and folly before it be too
late.&nbsp; Let them <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>hear the awful denunciations of
Scripture; and may that Scripture, through God&rsquo;s grace,
bring conviction to their minds and repentance to their
hearts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for
your miseries that shall come upon you.&nbsp; Your riches are
corrupted and your garments are moth-eaten.&nbsp; Your gold and
silver is cankered, and the rust of them shall be a witness
against you; and shall eat your flesh as it were fire: ye have
heaped treasure together for the last day.&rdquo; <a
name="citation59a"></a><a href="#footnote59a"
class="citation">[59a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;They that will be rich
fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and
hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and
perdition.&rdquo; <a name="citation59b"></a><a
href="#footnote59b" class="citation">[59b]</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dearly beloved, I beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims,
abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.&rdquo; <a
name="citation59c"></a><a href="#footnote59c"
class="citation">[59c]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;For the time past of our
life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles,
when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine,
revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries.&rdquo; <a
name="citation59d"></a><a href="#footnote59d"
class="citation">[59d]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Let no man deceive you
with vain words; for because of these things cometh the wrath of
God upon the children of disobedience.&rdquo; <a
name="citation59e"></a><a href="#footnote59e"
class="citation">[59e]</a>&nbsp; May those who now rise up early,
and late take rest, and eat the bread of carefulness, that they
may increase their worldly store, receive grace &ldquo;to lay up
treasure in heaven,&rdquo; not &ldquo;trusting in uncertain
riches, but in the living <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>God, who giveth us richly all things
to enjoy:&rdquo; <a name="citation60a"></a><a href="#footnote60a"
class="citation">[60a]</a> and may those who, placing few or no
restraints upon the appetites and passions of their animal
nature, ardently pursue impure, debasing, and guilty pleasures,
have their souls so sanctified, through the power of the Holy
Ghost, that, &ldquo;cleansed from all filthiness of the flesh and
spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God,&rdquo; <a
name="citation60b"></a><a href="#footnote60b"
class="citation">[60b]</a> they may desire only &ldquo;the joys
unspeakable, and full of glory, which are at God&rsquo;s right
hand for evermore.&rdquo;&nbsp; And may the envious, the
censorious, and the malicious, who cherish in their hearts
hostility and malignity towards their fellows, acquire the spirit
of Christian charity!&nbsp; For &ldquo;charity <i>suffereth long
and is kind</i>; <i>charity envieth not</i>; charity vaunteth not
itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly;
seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, <i>thinketh no
evil</i>; <i>rejoiceth not in iniquity</i>, <i>but rejoiceth in
the truth</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; There exist no passions in the human
breast, which in every age have excited so much scorn and
reprobation amongst generous and noble spirits as envy and
malice: there is a meanness in them which renders them
contemptible; there is a malignity which makes them detestable:
the virtuous heathen, therefore, viewed them with contemptuous
indignation; but the Christian must mourn over such bitter fruits
of an unchristian temper; he must <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>admonish those who foster them, that
these sins of the heart, as more difficult to be repented of, are
more likely to exclude from heaven than the failings which they
gloat upon with secret pleasure, and publish with malicious
satisfaction.&nbsp; The sins of uncharitableness cannot but be
peculiarly odious in the sight of Him, whose religion inculcates
the purest and kindest spirit of brotherly love, and who has made
our forgiving our brother his trespasses, the ground of our
asking the forgiveness of our own.&nbsp; We are, therefore,
strongly and repeatedly warned in Scripture against anger, envy,
hatred, revenge, and malice; whilst the opposite virtues are
urged upon us with equal force of exhortation and tenderness of
entreaty.&nbsp; &ldquo;I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord,
beseech you, that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are
called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering,
forbearing one another in love; endeavouring to keep the unity of
the Spirit in the bond of peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let all
bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking,
be put away from you, with all malice, and be ye kind one to
another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God, for
Christ&rsquo;s sake, hath forgiven you.&rdquo; <a
name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61"
class="citation">[61]</a>&nbsp; Let such, therefore, remembering
that their only hope of forgiveness consists in their obtaining
grace to overcome their uncharitable <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>temper and habits, hear also and obey
the similar admonition of another apostle: &ldquo;Wherefore,
laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and
envies, and all evil-speaking; as newborn babes, desire the
sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.&rdquo; <a
name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62"
class="citation">[62]</a></p>
<p>May all those who make a decided profession of religion, but
whose heart is not right before the Lord; the lukewarm, the
self-righteous, and the hypocritical; learn that God will never
accept of a divided heart; that He will never approve of a
self-righteous spirit, and will never receive the incense of
feigned lips.&nbsp; Hypocrisy must be peculiarly offensive, as it
is peculiarly insulting, to the Majesty of an omniscient and
omnipresent God.&nbsp; That one of his creatures should dare to
make His name or service a cloak to cover his selfish and worldly
views; should profess a great reverence for Him, only to secure
the applause, or procure the assistance of men, is at once such a
bold and impious fraud, as must excite the displeasure, and call
down the vengeance of an insulted and offended Deity.&nbsp; What!
shall the weak and miserable creature who has been graciously
allowed to approach his great Creator, and &ldquo;tell out his
wants and unburden his sorrows to Him in
prayer,&rdquo;&mdash;shall he pervert to his base ends this high
and holy privilege, and &ldquo;make <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>long prayers, that he may be seen of
men!&rdquo;&nbsp; Such a fearful profanation resembles that of
Belshazzar, when he used, at his unholy banquet, the sacred
vessels taken from the Temple at Jerusalem, and with them gave
honour to his false gods. <a name="citation63"></a><a
href="#footnote63" class="citation">[63]</a>&nbsp; For the
hypocrite, who worships in the sanctuary to advance his worldly
interest, is employing the holy ordinances of the Lord in the
service of Belial, who is his god.</p>
<p>It may be hoped that hypocrisy of this impious nature is rare;
but neither its criminality nor its extent are sufficiently
regarded by men in general.&nbsp; For what, in reality, are all
who make merely an outward profession of religion? they are all
hypocrites: they do not attend religious worship to offer their
sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to their Preserver and
Benefactor; but they pretend to do so; and perhaps might consider
themselves unjustly stigmatised, if the real cause of their being
in the courts of the Lord&rsquo;s house was stated to be, either
regard for reputation, to set an example, general custom, or the
force of habit.&nbsp; But if men go not to the house of prayer
for worship&mdash;and those who make merely an outward profession
of religion cannot be sincere in offering up any prayers&mdash;it
remains that some other motive must have drawn them there; and
whatever that may be, as the real <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>but not ostensible motive, it stamps
them as hypocrites.&nbsp; There also are, it may be feared, other
hypocrites, of a very different description, who lay claim to
more religion than they possess; and, in the cause of the Lord of
Hosts, profess more zeal for His honour than they feel.&nbsp; All
such&mdash;more especially if they assume a character of which
they know themselves to be totally unworthy, seeking to gratify
their pride or advance their interests; for then they are
hypocrites of the worst description;&mdash;expose themselves to
the righteous displeasure of the Lord.&nbsp; May men, therefore,
learn, that the profession of religion, without regard to its
principles, will, sooner or later, bring down upon them swift and
sudden destruction; for &ldquo;the prayer of the wicked is an
abomination unto the Lord,&rdquo; when &ldquo;they take the law
of God into their mouths, but hate to be reformed in their
hearts.&rdquo;&nbsp; And whilst their principles must always
correspond with their profession, their practice must be in
accordance with both.&nbsp; The repentance of the hypocrite is
extremely difficult: he has profaned, to his own ungodly
purposes, all the means of grace; and sometimes, so perfect
becomes the delusion of lengthened deception, he almost believes
himself really to be the character he has falsely assumed.&nbsp;
Nothing but Divine grace can rescue him from his alarming state;
for he resembles one who has himself poisoned the wholesome
aliment intended for his sustenance; <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>still the Great Physician of souls is
a sure refuge.&nbsp; May he, through Him, obtain mercy and
pardon, and escape having &ldquo;his portion with the hypocrites,
where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amongst the Pharisees it appears, from the severe reproofs our
blessed Lord directed against them, that both an hypocritical and
self-righteous spirit prevailed to a great extent.&nbsp; Such
will ever be the case where the forms are substituted for the
spirit of religion.&nbsp; It will then quickly degenerate into a
number of lifeless observances, and the shadow of the religion
will remain whilst the substance will be lost.&nbsp;
Self-righteousness, in this day, rests nearly upon the same
foundation as in the time of our Saviour.&nbsp; Amongst ourselves
it is often built upon the groundwork of regularity and
strictness in religious observances, and of belonging to a
particular sect or party.&nbsp; It is often characterised by an
appearance of much self-complacency and spiritual pride; still it
is at the same time distinguished generally by a correct standard
of morals, a due regard for decorum, and a strict attention to
religious duties.&nbsp; Alas! every one must lament that the
spirit is wanting which will give acceptability to these services
in the sight of God: for &ldquo;thus saith the high and lofty
One, that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the
high and holy place; with him also that is of a contrite and
humble <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>spirit; to revive the spirit of the humble, and to
revive the heart of the contrite ones.&rdquo; <a
name="citation66a"></a><a href="#footnote66a"
class="citation">[66a]</a>&nbsp; There exists not in the heart of
man a feeling more perfectly irreconcileable with his corrupt and
fallen nature, than spiritual pride.&nbsp; In the first place,
&ldquo;who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou
that thou didst not receive?&nbsp; Now if thou didst receive it,
why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?&rdquo; <a
name="citation66b"></a><a href="#footnote66b"
class="citation">[66b]</a>&nbsp; And in the second, &ldquo;Who
can tell how oft he offendeth?&nbsp; O cleanse thou me from my
secret faults!&nbsp; Keep thy servant also from presumptuous
sins, lest they get the dominion over me: so shall I be
undefiled, and innocent from the great offence.&rdquo; <a
name="citation66c"></a><a href="#footnote66c"
class="citation">[66c]</a>&nbsp; One of the first Christian
virtues is humility; and he must be equally ignorant of his own
heart and of the spirit of the Gospel, who prides himself upon
his excellences, instead of lamenting his deficiencies.&nbsp; A
deep consciousness of personal unworthiness; a fearful sense of
his little progress in holiness, in comparison with the
advantages which have been afforded to him; a humble thankfulness
that God has enabled him to advance some way in his Christian
calling; and an entire dependence on his Saviour for grace, for
strength, and guidance, for the time to come, generally
characterize those most favoured servants of the Lord who have
reached the highest attainments in piety, and best served <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>their
generation.&nbsp; May the self-righteous receive grace &ldquo;to
learn of Him&rdquo; who was &ldquo;meek and lowly of
heart,&rdquo; and then they will find present and eternal
&ldquo;rest unto their souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long halt ye between two opinions?&rdquo; was the
indignant enquiry addressed to the Israelites by the Prophet
Elijah: &ldquo;If the Lord be God, follow Him; if Baal, then
follow him.&rdquo; <a name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"
class="citation">[67]</a>&nbsp; In every age there have been too
many lukewarm in religion, to whom the same enquiry might be
addressed, for there has ever been the same disposition to make a
compromise between God and Mammon.&nbsp; They are unwilling to
forfeit all hope of the fair &ldquo;inheritance of the saints in
light;&rdquo; they are afraid to encounter the awful terrors of
the blackness of darkness for ever; still the world, with its
seductive pleasured and engrossing cares, takes a strong hold
upon the heart, and is like a withering blight upon the blossoms
and fruit of genuine piety.</p>
<p>There is no vitality of religious principle, and no
consistency of religious conduct.&nbsp; They profess the Gospel,
it is true; but they are desirous to accommodate it to their own
views and wishes, that it may not interfere with their worldly
advantage, not interrupt their present enjoyments.&nbsp; But such
a cold and calculating spirit, which appears ever to ask,
&ldquo;How little can I do, and yet get to heaven?&rdquo; <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>has nothing
in it of the Gospel of Christ.&nbsp; Our blessed Lord employs, in
the Revelations, terms expressive of the most contemptuous
rejection of the works of the Church of Laodicea, because it was
&ldquo;lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot.&rdquo; <a
name="citation68a"></a><a href="#footnote68a"
class="citation">[68a]</a>&nbsp; The whole tenor of Scripture
inculcates the duty of obedience to &ldquo;the first and great
commandment&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
mind.&rdquo; <a name="citation68b"></a><a href="#footnote68b"
class="citation">[68b]</a>&nbsp; And they can know little of the
glorious and blessed privileges of the children of God by
adoption and grace, who do not habitually look up to Him as
&ldquo;a reconciled Father in Christ Jesus our Lord;&rdquo; who
do not cry with humble but firm and confiding faith, &ldquo;Abba,
Father;&rdquo; and who do not obey, with willing and joyful
readiness, the command, &ldquo;My Son, give me thine heart, and
let thine eyes observe my ways.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a necessary
union between adoption and grace, between grace and holiness,
between holiness and love: &ldquo;as many as are led by the
Spirit of God, they are the sons of God:&rdquo; &ldquo;Ye are not
in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God
dwell in you:&rdquo; &ldquo;The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; They, therefore, who do not manifest in their
hearts and lives those blessed proofs of the indwelling of the
Spirit, renewed minds, sanctified affections, and holy obedience,
<a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>cannot be
said to &ldquo;walk after the Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Now if
any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his:&rdquo;
he is &ldquo;carnally minded;&rdquo; and &ldquo;to be carnally
minded is death;&rdquo; &ldquo;because the carnal mind is enmity
against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither
indeed can be.&nbsp; So then they that are in the flesh cannot
please God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, how does the faithful servant of the Lord mourn over the
lukewarm in religion, a class which may sometimes embrace those
dearest to him on earth&mdash;united to him by the closest ties
of blood&mdash;by the sweetest bonds of affection.&nbsp; He feels
for them, for he remembers the time when he had &ldquo;set his
affections on things of earth:&rdquo; He estimates fully the
difficulties they have to surmount, for he knows how hard it is
to &ldquo;set the affections on things above.&rdquo;&nbsp; For
this world invites us, through the medium of the senses, with
objects present, visible, and palpable; but it is only by the
power of abstraction, and through the medium of faith, we can
even contemplate the future invisible and unpalpable realities of
a spiritual world, whose rewards and joys are covered with a veil
which revelation has only raised so far as to show, that whilst
their nature transcends the power of human conception, their
extent exceeds the limits of human comprehension.&nbsp; He fears,
therefore, lest, bewildered by the false glare of earthly
attractions, they may never be able to fix the steady eye of
faith <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>upon
what human &ldquo;eye hath not seen, nor hath it entered into the
heart of men to conceive;&rdquo; he fears lest, still impelled
forward in the broad way of destruction by semblances of
happiness, as alluring but as illusive as the mirage of the
desert, they may never enter upon the narrow and often thorny
path of life, which leads to the Zion of our God.</p>
<p>How earnestly, therefore, does he entreat them not longer to
linger in the outward courts, but to enter at once into the
temple of our faith; not longer to starve themselves with
&ldquo;the beggarly elements of the Law,&rdquo; to which they
secretly cling, but to refresh and invigorate their souls with
the &ldquo;rich mercies&rdquo; of the Gospel dispensation, which
supplies every want, and satisfies every desire, when fully
understood, firmly believed, thankfully received, and implicitly
obeyed.&nbsp; For it is not generally that they seek to escape
the obligations to personal holiness, for they are moral men: it
is not that they wish to avoid the observances of religion, for
they are regular in their attendance on divine ordinances; but
they will not submit themselves to the sole guidance of that Holy
Spirit which can alone consecrate their prayers and sanctify
their obedience.&nbsp; Their case is stated by St. Paul in a few
words: they have &ldquo;the form without the power of
godliness;&rdquo; and being destitute of its power, they enjoy
not its present consolations,&mdash;they will possess not its
future rewards, unless, by <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>the transforming influence of divine
grace, they are enabled to give their, at present, divided hearts
to God.&nbsp; A merely formal profession of the Gospel never yet
supplied comfort in the hour of affliction&mdash;never cheered
the sufferings of the bed of pain&mdash;never took away the fear
of death.&nbsp; It may be, that when the understanding is
blinded, or the heart hardened, exhausted nature sometimes
willingly seeks relief from present suffering in death; but such
is an awful sign of spiritual insensibility.&nbsp; When the
conscience is fully awake, and the mind, in full possession of
its powers, is conscious of the rapid approach of death; the
Gospel of Christ alone has power to divest the destroyer of his
terrors by robbing him of his sting, and the grave of its
victory.&nbsp; Still it is only a heartfelt profession of the
Gospel, in which the approval of the understanding, and the
desire of the heart, accompany the utterance of the lips, from
which issue no lifeless words, but the earnest prayer for mercy
and forgiveness for faith and hope, for sanctification and
submission; which, proving that grace is employed in its blessed
and holy work of the soul&rsquo;s renewal, supports and comforts
in that awful hour, when the soul is preparing to meet its God
and Saviour.&nbsp; Oh that this consideration may have its due
weight to rouse the lukewarm from their state of apathy!&nbsp;
Can they imagine that their languid and lifeless services will be
acceptable in the sight of that God, <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>who is Himself love, and whose
motive, in offering them eternal life, is love?&nbsp; Can they
suppose their weak faith in the Saviour, their cold reception of
His inestimable blessings, will satisfy Him, who referred the
ignominious and painful death He endured to the greatness of His
love,&mdash;&ldquo;greater love hath no man than this, that a man
lay down his life for his friends.&rdquo; <a
name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a>&nbsp; If, in the various relations of
social life, the little services of affection are valued
infinitely higher than the more costly benefits which spring only
from a cold sense of duty:&mdash;if the willing obedience, the
watchful attention, and the tender offices of love are prized,
beyond all comparison, above the forced submission, the reluctant
compliance, and the unwilling attendance of fear:&mdash;can we
think for a moment that He, who has admitted us to all the
privileges of sonship, and has allowed us to approach Him in the
endearing character of children, and cry, Abba, Father, will
regard favourably the services which spring from slavish fear,
and not from filial love?&nbsp; It might be thought that the
consideration of the infinite love of God towards man, and of the
precious benefits conferred upon us by the Saviour, would fill
every soul with gratitude and love: to think that weak, sinful,
and guilty man, should be elevated to so exalted a relation to
God <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>as
that of son; to remember that his title to his high dignity was
purchased, by no less a sacrifice than the atonement made by Him,
who is the brightness of His Father&rsquo;s glory, and the
express image of His person,&mdash;present to the mind such an
astounding, and yet transporting view, of &ldquo;the length and
breadth, and depth and height,&rdquo; of &ldquo;the love of God,
which passeth knowledge,&rdquo; that we are constrained to
exclaim, &ldquo;Such things are too wonderful for me; I cannot
attain unto them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet, they affect not, they
influence not, that large class of men, the lukewarm in
religion!&nbsp; God now calls them by &ldquo;His judgments, which
are in the earth,&rdquo; to &ldquo;turn unto Him with all their
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; May they all receive grace, to obey the call,
and seek forgiveness at his hands; for there is impending over
them a most terrible curse&mdash;a curse which repentance only
can avert.&nbsp; &ldquo;If any love not the Lord Jesus Christ,
let him be Anathema Maranatha.&rdquo; <a name="citation73"></a><a
href="#footnote73" class="citation">[73]</a></p>
<p>Let, then, all the several classes of men, who, as
constituting the leading divisions of those who believe not, or
practise not, the truth as it is in Christ Jesus our
Lord&mdash;have been exhorted and warned &ldquo;to flee from the
wrath to come,&rdquo; be now earnestly intreated to imitate the
example of the Bereans of old, who &ldquo;were more noble than
those in Thessalonica, <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span><i>in that they received the Word
with all readiness of mind</i>, <i>and searched the Scriptures
daily</i>, <i>whether those things were so</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation74a"></a><a href="#footnote74a"
class="citation">[74a]</a></p>
<p>And may God accompany with his grace and blessing such study
of the Scriptures, that they who have heretofore neglected,
perverted, disobeyed, or rejected the Gospel, may, through
&ldquo;its marvellous light become wise unto
salvation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect,
thoroughly furnished unto all good works.&rdquo; <a
name="citation74b"></a><a href="#footnote74b"
class="citation">[74b]</a>&nbsp; In the &ldquo;lively oracles of
God,&rdquo; therefore, they will find instruction how to proceed
in the difficult work of true repentance.&nbsp; Let them not,
however, be dismayed at the difficulty of the undertaking, for
&ldquo;He who worketh in them to will and to do of His good
pleasure,&rdquo; is ever ready to succour and omnipotent to save,
&ldquo;all who come unto Him&rdquo; through Christ, &ldquo;who is
the way, the truth, and the life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let them not fear
the power of the great adversary of man, whose galling yoke they
long willingly bore; &ldquo;for the weapons of our warfare are
not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong
holds, casting down imaginations and every high thing that
exalteth itself against the knowledge of God; and <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>bringing into
captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.&rdquo; <a
name="citation75a"></a><a href="#footnote75a"
class="citation">[75a]</a>&nbsp; Still, at the same time, let
them underrate neither the difficulties nor the dangers which
await them.&nbsp; Spiritual as well as worldly prudence is shewn
in rightly estimating difficulties, that they may be the more
certainly overcome; and real courage, whether carnal or
spiritual, in learning the extent of danger, that it may be, as
the case requires, carefully avoided, or manfully combated.</p>
<p>The prophet Jeremiah, to prove the difficulty of a late
repentance, has used a figure which places it in a strong light;
&ldquo;Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his
spots? then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do
evil.&rdquo; <a name="citation75b"></a><a href="#footnote75b"
class="citation">[75b]</a>&nbsp; The apostle Peter, to shew the
extent of danger to the Christian, employs a simile not less
striking, &ldquo;Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion,
walketh about seeking whom he may devour.&rdquo; <a
name="citation75c"></a><a href="#footnote75c"
class="citation">[75c]</a>&nbsp; And St. Paul accumulates the
most forcible expressions to convey an adequate idea of the
dangerous nature of our spiritual warfare, &ldquo;for we wrestle
not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against
powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
spiritual wickedness in high places.&rdquo; <a
name="citation75d"></a><a href="#footnote75d"
class="citation">[75d]</a>&nbsp; It is most true, that when the
corruption of man&rsquo;s nature <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>has been increased in malignity by
the long indulgence of its sinful appetites and passions; when
his habits have become confirmed, inveterate, and almost second
nature through time; and when his severe master, the devil,
seeing him planning rebellion against his authority, and escape
from his power, employs his subtle arts to retain his dominion
over him: we have a case in which unassisted human nature must
despair.&nbsp; Passion is not tameable at the will of man,
appetite is not mortified at his bidding, habit is not overcome
at his command, the devil is not vanquished by his power.&nbsp;
On the contrary, they all reign and rule in the heart of the
unconverted, who have grown old in sin: there passion is
ungovernable, appetite irresistible, habit invincible, the devil
dominant and triumphant.</p>
<p>Well may every sinner start at this appalling picture of human
weakness and depravity, and well will it be for him, if, through
grace, he be thence led to exclaim&mdash;&ldquo;Oh wretched man
that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this
death!&rdquo; <a name="citation76a"></a><a href="#footnote76a"
class="citation">[76a]</a> and if he be enabled to apply to his
own case the answer, I thank God through Jesus Christ our
Lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;With man it is impossible&rdquo; to escape
from the debasing and enslaving effects of sin, &ldquo;but with
God all things are possible;&rdquo; <a name="citation76b"></a><a
href="#footnote76b" class="citation">[76b]</a> and &ldquo;thanks
be <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>to God
who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus.&rdquo; <a
name="citation77a"></a><a href="#footnote77a"
class="citation">[77a]</a></p>
<p>Through Him who loved us and gave Himself for us, we shall
prove more than conquerors over the great enemies of our
salvation.&nbsp; By the transforming power of divine grace the
will becomes renewed, the passions subjugated, the appetites
mortified, the habits changed; and the devil vanquished by the
great Captain of our salvation, loses his dominion over the
sanctified soul.&nbsp; Such is the mighty change wrought in
fallen and sinful man, when grace has done her perfect work; and
&ldquo;renewed in the spirit of his mind,&rdquo; he both
&ldquo;proves what is the good and perfect and acceptable will of
God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;presents his body a living sacrifice, holy
and acceptable unto God.&rdquo; <a name="citation77b"></a><a
href="#footnote77b" class="citation">[77b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Repent ye</span>, <span
class="smcap">therefore</span>, <span class="smcap">and be
converted</span>, <span class="smcap">that your sins may be
blotted out</span>, when the times of refreshing shall come from
the presence of the Lord.&rdquo; <a name="citation77c"></a><a
href="#footnote77c" class="citation">[77c]</a>&nbsp; Repent ye,
who have heretofore put conviction far from you, and have refused
to receive the Gospel as your standard of faith, your sole rule
of life.&nbsp; It may be, that to you, &ldquo;behold now is the
accepted time, behold now is the day of salvation;&rdquo; it may
be, that if ye will not hear His voice, but still harden your
hearts, upon you may be passed the terrible and irrevocable
sentence&mdash;&ldquo;it <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>is a people that do err in their
hearts; for they have not known my ways; unto whom I sware in my
wrath, that they should not enter into my rest.&rdquo; <a
name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78"
class="citation">[78]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Go thy way for this time</span>,
<span class="smcap">when I have a convenient season I will call
for thee</span>;&rdquo; was the language of Felix, when he
&ldquo;<i>trembled</i>,&rdquo; as Paul &ldquo;reasoned of
righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
such is the course adopted by thousands; they do not violently
repress the convictions of conscience; but endeavour to lull them
by that &ldquo;deceitful opiate&mdash;good resolves.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Not now</span>, is still the cry, when
conscience warns them; not now, to-morrow, next year,&mdash;and
thus repentance determined upon, but still deferred, flits before
them like the treacherous light which often misleads unwary
travellers, and lures them on with false hopes, until they plunge
into the black gulf of horrible anguish and despair.</p>
<p>This insane procrastination, which is so common and so fatal,
that it has been said, &ldquo;hell&rsquo;s road is paved with
good resolutions,&rdquo; arises principally from man&rsquo;s
natural wickedness, indolence, sinfulness, and love of sin; but
it is much promoted by mistaken ideas as to the nature of
repentance, which, by some, is considered at all times in their
own power.&nbsp; This fatal error&mdash;the grand cause of which
is ignorance of Scripture&mdash;is much favoured by the various
<a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>senses in
which the term repentance is employed: it is used to express
simply sorrow, sorrow and amendment, change of heart and
life.&nbsp; Now this latter sense exactly corresponds with
conversion, and the evil might, in some degree, be remedied, if
there were adopted, in the case of habitual sinners, the
definition of repentance given by Hammond: &ldquo;A change of
mind, or a conversion from sin to God; not some one bare act of
change, but a lasting, durable state of new life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
For men would have a difficulty in resting satisfied with
indefinitely postponing repentance, if they knew that repentance
to consist not merely in sorrow for sin, not merely in external
amendment, but in a change of the heart, in a renewal of the
mind, wrought by the Holy Ghost, and which man possesses no
inherent power to effect, but which is the gift of God through
Christ.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Repent ye</span>, <span
class="smcap">therefore</span>, <span class="smcap">and be
converted</span>, <span class="smcap">that your sins may be
blotted out</span>: all who have heretofore drawn your motives
and rules of actions from the world, and not from the Book of
Life&mdash;and as you value your immortal souls, consider no
proofs of conversion to be depended upon, except faith in the
Saviour, and reliance on His merits alone for salvation; love of
God as a reconciled father in Christ Jesus our Lord, shed abroad
in the heart by the power of the Holy Ghost; constant study of
the Scriptures as the rule of life; indulgence of no known <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>sin; and
dependence on divine grace for spiritual guidance, strength, and
consolation.&nbsp; Such an entire conversion of the whole man to
God is generally not only a progressive, but a slow operation:
during which partial relapses into old habits, which conscience
soon compels them to abandon;&mdash;unscriptural views of
reconciliation with God, in which the soul cannot rest
satisfied;&mdash;and artful stratagems of the great enemy of man
to win them back to wear publicly their badge of servitude, or
retain them in the camp of the faithful, as in reality, though
unknowingly, his deluded and secret followers;&mdash;all impede,
perplex, and endanger their course.</p>
<p>As the heart only knows its own bitterness, so each believer
only knows the mode of God&rsquo;s dealing with him in bringing
him to a knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus. <a
name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80"
class="citation">[80]</a>&nbsp; But the following sketch may be
received as presenting the outlines of a sincere conversion; and
may the future experience of those who are now earnestly and
affectionately entreated to &ldquo;turn unto God with all their
hearts,&rdquo; fill up the details.&nbsp; The conscience is first
troubled through the grace of God accompanying some strong
appeal; fear is excited; an examination is made into the state of
life, and the awful truth flashes upon the mind, that he is in
&ldquo;the broad way which leadeth to destruction,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;what is a <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>man profited, if he shall gain the whole world and lose
his own soul.&rdquo; <a name="citation81a"></a><a
href="#footnote81a" class="citation">[81a]</a>&nbsp; He now,
perhaps, attempts to appease his conscience by a compromise, by
reforming, in part, his life, but retaining his darling sins;
this unholy alliance between Christ and Belial may not be, and he
is ill at ease.&nbsp; He examines, therefore, more carefully the
word of life, and feels satisfied he merits only eternal
condemnation at the hand of a righteous God.&nbsp; His alarm
becomes terror, and he sets to work in good earnest to effect an
entire reformation of life, but too much in dependence on his own
strength.&nbsp; He fails, and again and again is betrayed into
his old sins, through the weakness of his nature, the power of
temptation, and the want of spiritual strength.&nbsp; The
repeated failures at length convince him of his own weakness and
utter helplessness, and he begins to distrust himself, and trust
more and more in his Saviour.&nbsp; The dark prospect now begins
to brighten by the dawning of a better day, and slowly the sun of
righteousness rising upon his soul, dispels the mists of error,
prejudice, and passion, and reveals the Saviour as &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">the way</span>, <span class="smcap">the
truth</span>, <span class="smcap">and the life</span>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation81b"></a><a href="#footnote81b"
class="citation">[81b]</a>&nbsp; He sees his road more clearly,
he better understands how God &ldquo;made Him to be sin for us,
who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God
in Him,&rdquo; <a name="citation81c"></a><a href="#footnote81c"
class="citation">[81c]</a> and joyfully accepts the free,
unmerited, <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>and most gracious offers of salvation made in Christ
Jesus our Lord, through whom, &ldquo;being justified by faith, we
have peace with God.&rdquo; <a name="citation82a"></a><a
href="#footnote82a" class="citation">[82a]</a>&nbsp; He increases
in faith, he rejoices in his privileges, he grows in grace, but
he is still watchful and sober-minded: whilst he throws himself
entirely on the mercy of God in Christ in whom we are
&ldquo;complete;&rdquo; and relies on Him for His &ldquo;grace,
which is sufficient for us, for it is made perfect in
weakness;&rdquo; <a name="citation82b"></a><a href="#footnote82b"
class="citation">[82b]</a> he remits not his vigilance, he
relaxes not his endeavours, but &ldquo;forgetting those things
which are behind, and reaching forth unto those which are before,
he presses toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of
God in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; <a name="citation82c"></a><a
href="#footnote82c" class="citation">[82c]</a>&nbsp; He earnestly
prays and labours to be enabled to adorn the doctrine of God our
Saviour in all things; to perfect holiness in his faith and fear,
and to have his conversation in heaven, from whence also we look
for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: &ldquo;who shall change
our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious
body, according to the working whereby He is able even to subdue
all things unto Himself.&rdquo; <a name="citation82d"></a><a
href="#footnote82d" class="citation">[82d]</a></p>
<p>The combat which awaits the young convert is severe, but not
alarming, if he take the whole armour of God; &ldquo;Wherefore
take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to
withstand <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.&nbsp;
Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and
having on the breastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod
with the preparation of the Gospel of peace; above all, taking
the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the
fiery darts of the wicked.&nbsp; And take the helmet of
salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit,
and watching thereunto with all perseverance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clad in the full panoply of the Gospel, the Christian warrior
has nothing to dread: for his armour is of heavenly temper; the
arm of Omnipotence sustains him; and the glorious shield of the
Saviour &ldquo;will cover his head in the day of
battle.&rdquo;&nbsp; But if the danger appear slight, let him not
presume; if appalling, let him not despair; excessive confidence
often risks, and despondence often loses, the battle won by
undaunted, but cool and cautious courage: and of such a nature is
Christian faith, by which the soldier of the cross is enabled to
fulfil his baptismal vow, &ldquo;not to be ashamed to confess the
faith of Christ crucified, and manfully to fight under His
banner, against sin, the world, and the devil, and to continue
Christ&rsquo;s faithful soldier and servant unto his life&rsquo;s
end.&rdquo; <a name="citation83"></a><a href="#footnote83"
class="citation">[83]</a></p>
<p><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>Let
not, therefore, the penitent suppose the dangers and difficulties
which await him to be so great as almost to be insuperable; nor
yet that they are so small as to be easily overcome: it is
sufficient for him to know, that that Master whom he serves, and
who appoints his lot, will, if he commit himself to Him as a
faithful Creator, supply him with strength equal to his trials,
and make those trials help him forward on his heaven-ward
journey.&nbsp; Upon setting out, however, let him be admonished,
that there are three things which he ought to bear in mind.</p>
<p>First: let him not mistake transient feelings for settled
principles, nor partial amendment for complete reformation: the
sanguine sometimes, through natural temperament, are unduly
elated; the desponding, through the same cause, unduly depressed;
and thus both form false estimates as to the degree of their
advancement in spiritual life.&nbsp; Whilst it also sometimes
unfortunately happens, that after the first terrors of awakened
conscience pass away, the fervours of devotional feeling subside,
and there ensue listlessness, negligence, and a return to former
evil courses: &ldquo;he that received the seed into stony places,
the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth
it; yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a
while.&rdquo; <a name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84"
class="citation">[84]</a>&nbsp; Let him, in the second place, be
especially <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>on his guard against partial or perverted views of the
doctrines and duties of our holy faith: some, because we are
saved through faith in the merits of the Saviour, have abused the
grace of God, by an unholy profession, or have under-rated the
value of Christian graces and virtues; and others, because of the
obligations to personal holiness, and of the rewards held out to
faithful servants, in the Gospel, have depreciated the value of
faith, and have reduced the great scheme of salvation to little
more than a moral obedience.&nbsp; And lastly, let him take care,
that when, through divine grace, he has surmounted the
difficulties which attend his first entrance upon the
&ldquo;narrow way which leadeth unto life;&rdquo; and his ardent
and confident spirit is full of eager anticipation of the eternal
rest and peace which await him on his arrival at the &ldquo;city
of the Living God,&rdquo; <a name="citation85"></a><a
href="#footnote85" class="citation">[85]</a> whose fair bulwarks
the eye of faith may already have descried at an immense
distance; let him &ldquo;be not high-minded, but fear:&rdquo;
enemies, though invisible, still surround him; dangers, though
hidden, still lurk in his path.&nbsp; Should, on the other hand,
the journey prove toilsome, and his spirit be often perplexed
with doubts, and alarmed with fears; should no distant prospect
of the mansions of eternal rest break upon his enraptured view,
solace his weary soul, and brighten his cheerless path: let <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>him not be
dismayed, but hope: a &ldquo;friend that sticketh closer than a
brother,&rdquo; <a name="citation86a"></a><a href="#footnote86a"
class="citation">[86a]</a> though unseen, is near; the city of
refuge, though undiscoverable by his anxious eye, is nigh at
hand.&nbsp; If, in the first case, he &ldquo;persevere unto the
end;&rdquo; if, in the second, &ldquo;he faint not;&rdquo; he
will reap an &ldquo;eternal and exceeding weight of glory;&rdquo;
<a name="citation86b"></a><a href="#footnote86b"
class="citation">[86b]</a> for, on his approach, the bright
portals of the new Jerusalem shall be thrown open, and he will be
welcomed by the Celestial King, with the transporting words,
&ldquo;Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into
the joy of thy Lord.&rdquo; <a name="citation86c"></a><a
href="#footnote86c" class="citation">[86c]</a></p>
<h3>II.&nbsp; The Christian&rsquo;s duty of labouring to advance,
as far as in him lies, a national reformation, under Divine
visitations.</h3>
<p>The duty <i>of personal reformation</i> under Divine
visitations, has been dwelt upon at considerable length; at once
from its private and public importance: for it is thus only a
national reformation can be effected.&nbsp; The good Christian
will ever discharge equally faithfully all the duties and
obligations which attach to him as an individual and as a member
of society.&nbsp; Little is he acquainted with the Catholic
spirit and scope of Christianity, who supposes the believer to be
occupied solely in securing his own salvation.&nbsp; Such conduct
would defeat its own purpose, as being incompatible with <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>the very
nature of Christian duty; which is not limited to the individual,
his family, his friends, his neighbourhood, nor yet to his
country, but extends to the whole household of faith; to the
great family of Christ; to the whole world for which the Saviour
died, and in which all should labour to promote the advancement
of true religion.&nbsp; Whilst, therefore, the Christian is
striving in secret, by means known only to God and to himself, to
&ldquo;enter in at the strait gate,&rdquo; &ldquo;to make his
calling and election sure;&rdquo; he considers it an imperative
obligation, the neglect of which would involve certain
condemnation, to &ldquo;labour to advance the glory of God, and
the present and future welfare of mankind.&rdquo;&nbsp; If, then,
the command, &ldquo;let your light so shine before men, that they
may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in
heaven,&rdquo; <a name="citation87a"></a><a href="#footnote87a"
class="citation">[87a]</a> is to be obeyed under ordinary
circumstances; when &ldquo;<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s
judgments are in the earth</span>,&rdquo; extraordinary exertions
must be made in the hope that, through the Divine blessing,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">the inhabitants of the world will
learn righteousness</span>.&rdquo; <a name="citation87b"></a><a
href="#footnote87b" class="citation">[87b]</a>&nbsp; Oh! what
extensive and blessed effects would arise if this holy principle
of our faith were more generally acted upon amongst Christians;
and all, at the same time, &ldquo;walked worthy of the vocation
wherewith they are called, with all lowliness and meekness, <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>with
long-suffering, forbearing one another in love; endeavouring to
keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.&rdquo; <a
name="citation88a"></a><a href="#footnote88a"
class="citation">[88a]</a>&nbsp; God grant that in times which
require such perfect union and co-operation amongst Christians,
they may receive grace to lay aside their rivalries, their
divisions, their jealousies; and as there is &ldquo;one Lord, one
faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all,
and through all, and in all;&rdquo; <a name="citation88b"></a><a
href="#footnote88b" class="citation">[88b]</a> so they may seek
but one object, the extension of the Messiah&rsquo;s kingdom;
they may employ but one means; the diffusion of the light of the
Gospel; and they may know but one spirit, the spirit of charity
and brotherly love.</p>
<p>Let then all Christians be now very zealous for the honour of
the Lord of Hosts, and direct their combined efforts against the
prevailing sins of the day.&nbsp; True believers &ldquo;are the
salt of the earth;&rdquo; and the more abundantly they are
sprinkled over the land, the more effectually the corrupting
effects of sin will be counteracted: they are the
&ldquo;leaven&rdquo; of the Gospel; and the more thoroughly they
are diffused through the whole mass of society, the more
certainly a national reformation will be produced.</p>
<p>How great is the improvement which an active and pious
individual sometimes effects in a neighbourhood!&mdash;an
improvement which, commencing <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>in one place, often spreads far
around.&nbsp; How extensive then might be the blessed effects of
the true servants of God acting in full and unanimous
co-operation!&mdash;General alarm has caused much good to be
done, in cleansing the towns and villages of the kingdom from
physical pollutions; let there be shown the same zeal and energy
in the removal of moral pollutions, so much more pernicious and
fatal, as being destructive of both body and soul.&nbsp; And then
this visitation &ldquo;shall turn&rdquo; out&mdash;as does every
visitation, when duly improved&mdash;&ldquo;to the profit, and
help forward in the right way that leadeth unto everlasting
life,&rdquo; <a name="citation89a"></a><a href="#footnote89a"
class="citation">[89a]</a> thousands who might long have
continued in a thoughtless and guilty neglect of God.&nbsp; For
how beneficial has the furnace of affliction been often found! it
is a certain assayer of religious principles; it detects the base
coinage of the world, which bears indeed the Divine
superscription, but is neither formed of the pure ore of the
Gospel, nor stamped with the seal of the Spirit; and proves the
intrinsic value of the unadulterated metal of the heavenly
treasury which &ldquo;cometh forth as gold.&rdquo; <a
name="citation89b"></a><a href="#footnote89b"
class="citation">[89b]</a></p>
<p>The leading heads of the duty of believers, as members of
society, under circumstances like the present, have already been
thus generally stated: let them publicly bear testimony at once
to the <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>justice and mercy of God&rsquo;s dispensations; and
strive earnestly to rouse the nation to a sense of its
guiltiness, which has exposed it to the divine displeasure: let
them, in dependence on the blessing of Heaven, labour to
eradicate all infidel and heretical opinions; to advance a
reformation of public morals, and to promote a general diffusion
of true religion, sound learning, and useful knowledge.&nbsp;
Upon these several heads it is proposed now to offer some brief
observations: And may <span class="smcap">He</span>, who blesses
the feeblest efforts made in dependence on His gracious aid, and
for the honour of His great name, bless this humble endeavour to
rouse some to a more active and faithful discharge of the duties
of their stations; and to excite in others a spirit of enquiry,
and draw forth from them a declaration of opinion, as to the
course which this Christian people should adopt under the present
Divine visitation.&nbsp; England has been long highly favoured
and greatly blessed; she has been placed as an ensign amongst the
nations, and as a city set on a hill; she has been a depositary
of genuine Christianity, and has been instrumental, in the hands
of Providence, in conveying the light of the Gospel to nations
&ldquo;lying in darkness and the shadow of death.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
her may our blessed Lord&rsquo;s pathetic lamentation over
Jerusalem never apply: &ldquo;And when he was come near, he
beheld the city, and wept over it, saying; if thou hadst known,
<a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>even thou,
at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace!
but now they are hid from thine eyes:&rdquo; <a
name="citation91a"></a><a href="#footnote91a"
class="citation">[91a]</a> rather, in this our day, may
&ldquo;the Father of Lights,&rdquo; <a name="citation91b"></a><a
href="#footnote91b" class="citation">[91b]</a> from whom
&ldquo;every good gift, and every perfect gift cometh,&rdquo;
impart to all that are in authority, &ldquo;the spirit of wisdom
and revelation in the knowledge of Him.&rdquo; <a
name="citation91c"></a><a href="#footnote91c"
class="citation">[91c]</a>&nbsp; Rather, may He enable all
persons to &ldquo;walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
redeeming the time, because the days are evil;&mdash;to be not
unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord
is;&mdash;giving thanks always for all things unto God and the
Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; submitting
themselves one to another in the fear of God.&rdquo; <a
name="citation91d"></a><a href="#footnote91d"
class="citation">[91d]</a>&nbsp; Then may the storm now
gathering, prove at once a punishment and a blessing from the
hand of God.&nbsp; Seasons of danger and suffering to churches
and nations have often resembled the storms of the natural world,
which, however alarming and destructive at the time, are
productive of subsequent good, by freeing the atmosphere from the
impurities accumulated during a long season of calm and
sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will ye do in the day of visitation and in the
desolation which shall come from far, to whom will ye flee for
help?&rdquo;&nbsp; Such is the enquiry which <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>has been
already addressed to the nation at large; to real, and to nominal
Christians; let the faithful servants of the Lord throughout the
land cause it to be sounded in the ears of a sinful nation; and
let each use the utmost extent of his individual influence, in
co-operation with others, to endeavour to rouse, through the
Divine blessing and guidance, a people sunk into religious
indifference and apathy.&nbsp; They are &ldquo;visited,&rdquo;
and that not &ldquo;after the visitation of all men;&rdquo; for a
pestilence as new in character, as fatal in its effects, has
overtaken them; and their visitation has indeed come from far,
for it has travelled from the remote bounds of their colonial
empire.&nbsp; Still we have too much cause to apprehend that
there are thousands who have never considered the awful character
of the visitation, nor asked themselves the question, to whom
shall we flee for help?</p>
<p>An irreligious age is little inclined to recognise the hand of
God in the course of events, which are generally ascribed to
natural causes and human means.&nbsp; But philosophy as well as
Revelation will satisfy the mind of every impartial and deep
enquirer, that nature must work under the control and direction
of the great Author of nature.&nbsp; It would be to practically
deny that God was the great governor of the universe, to suppose
that nature or chance was allowed, unchecked and unguided, to
produce the mighty results often referred <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>to its sole
agency.&nbsp; Sherlock has stated this with great force and
clearness.&nbsp; &ldquo;The same wisdom and power which made the
world must govern it too: it is only a creating power that can
preserve: that which owes its very being to power must depend
upon the power that made it, for it can have no principle of
self-subsistence independent of its cause: it is only creating
wisdom that perfectly understands the nature of all things, that
sees all the springs of motion, that can correct the errors of
nature, that can suspend or direct the influence of natural
causes, that can govern hearts, change men&rsquo;s purposes,
inspire wisdom and counsel, restrain or let loose their
passions.&nbsp; It is only an Infinite Mind that can take care of
all the world; that can allot every creature its portion; that
can adjust the interests of states and kingdoms; that can bring
good out of evil, and order out of confusion.&rdquo; <a
name="citation93"></a><a href="#footnote93"
class="citation">[93]</a>&nbsp; It would, therefore, be not less
unphilosophical than unchristian to ascribe to any spontaneous
operations of nature, a new and terrible pestilence, which has
swept away more than twenty millions of human beings from the
face of the earth.&nbsp; Nor may it be accounted for by an
extraordinary combination of accidental circumstances; for
&ldquo;the most unexpected events, how casual soever they appear
to us, are foreseen and ordered by God.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For
can we think otherwise, when we see <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>as many visible marks of wisdom, and
goodness, and justice, in what we call chance, as in any other
acts of Providence?&nbsp; Nay, when the wisdom of Providence is
principally seen in the government of fortuitous events?&nbsp;
When we see a world wisely made, though we did not see it made,
yet we conclude, that it was not made by chance, but by a Wise
Being; and by the same reason, when we see accidental events,
nay, a long incoherent series of accidents concur to the
producing the most admirable effects, we ought to conclude, that
there is a wise invisible hand which governs chance, which of
itself can do nothing wisely.&nbsp; When the lives and fortunes
of men, the fate of kingdoms and empires, the successes of war,
the changes of government are so often determined and brought
about by the most visible accidents; when chance defeats the
wisest counsels and greatest power; when good men are rewarded,
and the Church of God preserved by appearing chances; when bad
men are punished by chance, and the very chance whereby they are
punished, carries the marks of their sins upon it, for which they
are punished; I say, can any man in such cases think that all
this is mere chance?&nbsp; When, how accidental soever the means
are or appear to be, whereby such things are done, there is no
appearance of chance at all in the event; but the changes and
revolutions, the rewards and punishments, are <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>all as wisely
done, as if there had been nothing of chance and accident in
it.&nbsp; This is the great security of our lives amidst all the
uncertainties of fortune, that chance itself cannot hurt us
without a Divine commission.&nbsp; This is a sure foundation of
faith, and hope, and trust in God; how calamitous and desperate
soever our external condition seems to be, that God never wants
means to help; that He has a thousand unseen ways, a whole army
of accidents and unexpected events at command to disappoint such
designs, which no visible art or power can disappoint, and to
save those whom no visible power can save.&rdquo; <a
name="citation95"></a><a href="#footnote95"
class="citation">[95]</a>&nbsp; Nor may we suppose that this
fearful pestilence is merely permitted, and not appointed and
directed by God.&nbsp; &ldquo;God&rsquo;s government of events
consists in ordering and appointing whatever good or evil shall
befall men; for according to the Scripture we must attribute such
a government to God, as makes all these events <i>His will and
doing</i>; and nothing can be His will and doing, but what He
wills and orders.&nbsp; Some men think it enough to say, that God
permits every thing that is done, but will by no means allow that
God wills, and orders, and appoints it, which, they are afraid,
will charge the divine Providence with all the evil that is done
in the world; and truly so it would, did God order and appoint
the evil to be <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>done; but though God orders and appoints what evils
every man shall suffer, He orders and appoints no man to do the
evil; He only permits some men to do mischief, and appoints who
shall suffer by it, which is the short resolution of the
case.&nbsp; To attribute the evils which some men suffer, merely
to God&rsquo;s permission, is to destroy the government of
Providence; for bare permission is not government.&rdquo; <a
name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96"
class="citation">[96]</a>&nbsp; We arrive, therefore, at the
conclusion, that this malady, which has traversed nearly the
whole of two continents, is by the will and appointment of
God.&nbsp; And none need inquire wherefore it has been
sent.&nbsp; The dispensations of the Almighty are to reward or
punish, warn and amend nations and individuals.&nbsp; The fearful
character of the pestilence proves that it is to punish and warn
the offending nations, and may it also amend and lead them,
through the grace of God, to humble themselves under His mighty
hand, and bow with submission to His just judgments on a guilty
world!</p>
<p>It is, therefore, the bounden duty of the servants of the
Lord, every where, privately and publicly, to bear testimony to
God&rsquo;s government of nations and individuals.&nbsp; It is
not sufficient that they believe, act upon, and inculcate in
their families, a trust in Divine Providence.&nbsp; The great
truth, that &ldquo;<span class="smcap">the most high ruleth in
the kingdom of</span> <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span><span
class="smcap">men</span>,&rdquo; <a name="citation97a"></a><a
href="#footnote97a" class="citation">[97a]</a> should be bound
&ldquo;for a sign on their heads, and as frontlets between their
eyes.&rdquo; <a name="citation97b"></a><a href="#footnote97b"
class="citation">[97b]</a>&nbsp; They should proclaim every
where, that upon this great fundamental principle, rest the
prayer and worship addressed to God.&mdash;&ldquo;This much is
certain,&rdquo; observes Sherlock, &ldquo;that without this
belief, that God takes a particular care of all his creatures, in
the government of all events that can happen to them, there is no
reason nor pretence for most of the particular duties of public
worship.&nbsp; For most of the acts of worship consider God not
merely as an Universal Cause, (could we form any notion of a
general providence, without any care of particular creatures, or
particular events), but as our particular Patron, Protector, and
Preserver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To fear God, and to stand in awe of His justice; to
trust and depend on Him in all conditions; to submit patiently to
His will, under all afflictions; to pray to Him for the supply of
all our wants, for the relief of our sufferings, for protection
and defence; to love and praise Him for the blessings we enjoy,
for peace, and plenty, and health, for friends and benefactors,
and all prosperous successes: I say, these are not the acts of
reasonable men, unless they believe that God has the supreme
disposal of all events, and takes a particular care of us.&nbsp;
For if any good or evil can befall us without God&rsquo;s <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>particular
order and appointment, we have no reason to trust in God, who
does not always take care of us; we have no reason to bear our
sufferings patiently at God&rsquo;s hand, and in submission to
His will; for we know not whether our sufferings be God&rsquo;s
will or not; we have no reason to love and praise God for every
blessing and deliverance we receive, because we know not whether
it come from God; and it is to no purpose to pray to God for
particular blessings, if He does not concern Himself in
particular events; but if we believe that God takes a particular
care of us all, and that no good or evil happens to us but as He
pleases; all these acts of religious worship are both reasonable,
necessary, and just.&rdquo; <a name="citation98"></a><a
href="#footnote98" class="citation">[98]</a></p>
<p>The great duty of believers every where to declare and
maintain, that &ldquo;<span class="smcap">God governeth all
things both in heaven and earth</span>,&rdquo; is dwelt upon more
at large, because a neglect,&mdash;if not a disbelief,&mdash;of a
particular Providence, which constitutes practical, and often
tends to avowed infidelity, has been already stated to be one of
the most crying sins,&mdash;I may almost say the most crying
sin&mdash;of the day.&nbsp; Some openly disclaim all belief in
God&rsquo;s government of the world; others admit it, but are not
influenced by it; and others acknowledge a general, but deny a
particular Providence.&nbsp; These <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>latter appear not to be aware of the
manifest contradiction which their belief involves.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To talk of a general Providence without God&rsquo;s care
and government of every particular creature is manifestly
unreasonable and absurd; for, whatever reasons oblige us to own a
Providence, oblige us to own a particular Providence.&nbsp; If
creation be a reason, why God should preserve and take care of
what He has made; this is a reason why He should take care of
every creature, because there is no creature, but what He made;
and if the whole world consist of particulars, it must be taken
care of in the care of particulars; for if all particulars
perish, as they may do, if no care be taken to preserve them, the
whole must perish.&nbsp; And there is the same reason for the
government of mankind; for the whole is governed in the
government of parts; and mankind cannot be well governed without
the wise government of every particular man.&rdquo; <a
name="citation99"></a><a href="#footnote99"
class="citation">[99]</a></p>
<p>We may hope that secret disbelief, or open denial, of a Divine
Providence, does not exist to a great extent; but of this every
observer must be satisfied, that a practical disregard of
God&rsquo;s providential care and government is gaining ground in
this country.&nbsp; Nor are its effects to be seen only in the
conduct of individuals, they may be observed in the proceedings
of public bodies.&nbsp; Nothing can <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>bespeak this more strongly, than the
altered language of the day as regards society, business, and
public transactions.</p>
<p>The time was when it was carefully framed in accordance with
the apostolic injunction, &ldquo;for that ye ought to say <span
class="smcap">if the Lord will</span>, we shall live and do this
or that.&rdquo; <a name="citation100"></a><a href="#footnote100"
class="citation">[100]</a>&nbsp; Now it is evidently dictated by
that bold spirit of self-confidence, which &ldquo;having not God
in all its thoughts,&rdquo; says &ldquo;to-day or to-morrow <i>we
will go</i> into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy
and sell and get gain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor do the actions of men in
their public and private capacities contradict their
language.&nbsp; The time was, when this nation, sensible how
highly it had been blessed by Providence, and deeply grateful to
the Giver of all good, made it a rule to recognise the hand of
God in all things.&nbsp; When His chastisements were upon the
land, there was a fast; when deliverance was vouchsafed, there
was a thanksgiving; every visitation was received as a just
infliction; every escape as an unmerited blessing.&nbsp; Such was
the conduct of the people and government, during their late
struggle of unexampled difficulty, through which the Providence
of the Almighty carried them in safety, and during which the soil
of England alone was untrodden by the foot of the invader,
unstained by the blood of her sons.</p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Let,
then, all the faithful servants of God, who believe in the
government and confide in the protection of His Providence,
&ldquo;be instant in season and out of season,&rdquo; to
counteract this evil principle which corrupts, paralyzes, and
nullifies faith; which produces pride, self-confidence, and
self-complacency; and exposes to the severe displeasure and heavy
judgments of Him whom it &ldquo;robbeth of the honour due unto
His name.&rdquo;&nbsp; History, viewed by the aid of that light
which revelation has shed upon it, proves this incontestably, by
supplying both individual and national examples, with the latter
of which we are, at present, alone concerned.</p>
<p>All nations are under the government of the King of kings and
Lord of lords.&nbsp; &ldquo;His kingdom ruleth over all;&rdquo;
all are instruments in His hand to accomplish the secret purpose
of His will.&nbsp; They may be rebellious and disobedient, but
they cannot harden themselves against God and prosper.&nbsp; He
exhorts and warns, He threatens and visits; but if they go on
still in their wickedness, they soon fill up the measure of their
iniquity; the messenger of justice speeds forth, the sentence is
delivered, and they cease to be a nation.&nbsp; It is thus great
empires in succession have passed away; human reason discovers in
their rise, their progress, their decay, and their destruction,
nothing more than the ordinary operation of natural causes;
revelation raises the veil which envelopes the records of remote
antiquity, <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>and discovers the workings of a Divine agency, by which
Providence overrules the selfish and short-sighted policy of man,
to the development of the mighty and mysterious plans which
embrace the government of the world.&nbsp; And that blind and
presumptuous man may have no ground to suppose, that the fate of
empires is dependent solely upon human causes, the overthrow of
the guilty nations of antiquity, by the Divine command, was
foretold, and exactly fulfilled.&nbsp; Hence we may learn the
sudden and swift destruction, which neglect of Providence,
disregard of the authority, and disobedience to the commands of
Him, who has said, &ldquo;I am the Lord, I change not,&rdquo; <a
name="citation102"></a><a href="#footnote102"
class="citation">[102]</a> will, at last, bring upon any
Christian nation, which long continues to refuse the overtures of
pardon and reconciliation, made by a gracious, a merciful, and
long-suffering God.&nbsp; Predicted destruction overtook the
Assyrian and Babylonian empires; and the final desolation of
their capitals was foretold.&nbsp; The book of the prophet Nahum
opens with &ldquo;the burden of Nineveh,&rdquo; which abounds
with the most powerful descriptions of the terrible overthrow of
the Assyrian empire, and the utter desolation of its vast and
splendid capital.&nbsp; Zephaniah looks still further into
futurity, and presents a sad but faithful picture of its final
doom.&nbsp; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Lord will be terrible
unto them</span>:&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>And he will stretch out
his hand </i><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span><i>against the north</i>, <i>and destroy Assyria</i>;
<i>and will make Nineveh a desolation</i>, <i>and dry like the
wilderness</i>.&nbsp; And flocks shall lie down in the midst of
her, all the beasts of the nations; both the cormorant and the
bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it: their voice shall
sing in the windows, desolation shall be in the thresholds; for
He shall uncover the cedar-work.&nbsp; This is the rejoicing city
that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, <i>I am</i>,
<i>and there is none beside me</i>: how is she become a
desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in; every one that
passeth by her shall hiss and wag his head.&rdquo; <a
name="citation103a"></a><a href="#footnote103a"
class="citation">[103a]</a>&nbsp; So literally have these
striking images of entire and lonely desolation been fulfilled,
that in the second century, the very site of the once proud and
famous capital of the Assyrian empire was matter of
dispute.&nbsp; And as the ruin of Babylon was equally complete,
so the language of prophecy is equally clear and descriptive of
its entire destruction, &ldquo;O thou that dwellest upon many
waters, abundant in treasures, thy end is come and the measure of
thy covetousness.&nbsp; Though Babylon should mount up to heaven,
and though she should fortify the height of her strength, <i>yet
from</i> <span class="smcap">me</span> <i>shall spoilers come
unto her</i>, <i>saith the Lord</i>.&nbsp; Oh Lord, thou hast
spoken against this place to cut it off, that none shall remain
in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for
ever.&rdquo; <a name="citation103b"></a><a href="#footnote103b"
class="citation">[103b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>Nor
was the fate of these empires and cities alone foretold: the long
degradation of Egypt, which has been so exactly fulfilled, was
predicted: &ldquo;it shall be the basest of the kingdoms, neither
shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: <span
class="smcap">for I will diminish them</span>, <span
class="smcap">that they shall no more rule over the
nations</span>.&rdquo; <a name="citation104a"></a><a
href="#footnote104a" class="citation">[104a]</a>&nbsp; The evils
impending over rich and proud Tyre, whilst still in the plenitude
of her power and greatness were announced by Isaiah in terms very
applicable to that great emporium of commerce: &ldquo;Is this
your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her own
feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.&nbsp; Who hath taken
this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are
princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth?&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">The Lord of Hosts hath purposed it</span>, to
stain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the
honourable of the earth.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">He</span>
<i>stretched out His hand over the sea</i>; <span
class="smcap">He</span> <i>shook the kingdoms</i>: <i>the</i>
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> <i>hath given a commandment
against the merchant city</i>, <i>to destroy the strong holds
thereof</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation104b"></a><a
href="#footnote104b" class="citation">[104b]</a>&nbsp; But it was
reserved for Ezekiel to foretell the full extent of the fearful
ruin which was to overtake this renowned city: and he has done
so, in terms so brief, and yet so minutely descriptive of its
present state, as to have excited the observation of all modern
travellers: &ldquo;<i>it shall </i><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span><i>be a place for the spreading of
nets in the midst of the sea</i>, <span class="smcap">for I have
spoken it</span>, <span class="smcap">saith the Lord God</span>:
and it shall become a spoil to the nations.&rdquo; <a
name="citation105a"></a><a href="#footnote105a"
class="citation">[105a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;I <span
class="smcap">will make</span> <i>thee like the top of a
rock</i>: thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon, thou shalt
be built no more; for I the Lord have spoken it, saith the Lord
God.&rdquo; <a name="citation105b"></a><a href="#footnote105b"
class="citation">[105b]</a>&nbsp; Thus, when Maundrell visited
the ruins of Tyre, he found &ldquo;its present inhabitants to be
a few wretches, subsisting chiefly by fishing, who seem to be
preserved in this place by Divine Providence, as a visible
argument how God has fulfilled His word concerning
Tyre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor were the predictive denunciations of Divine vengeance upon
sinful nations, confined to times of a very remote
antiquity:&mdash;the prophet&rsquo;s eye glancing through the
long vista of coming years, foresaw, and his voice foretold, the
empire which the Ruler of the destiny of nations had decreed to
Greece and Rome.&nbsp; But there is a people which remain unto
this day, at once a living testimony to the truth of Divine
revelation, and a living monument of the certainty of Divine
punishment.&nbsp; From the Jews this country may draw a very
instructive lesson; for there are some striking points of
agreement in their earlier history, and would that there the
parallel might stop!&nbsp; The Jews were the peculiar people of
God.&mdash;&ldquo;Thou art a holy people <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>unto the
Lord thy God: <i>the Lord thy God hath chosen thee</i> to be a
special people unto Himself, above all people that are on the
face of the earth:&rdquo; this kingdom has also long enjoyed an
extraordinary degree of favour, protection, and blessing, at the
hand of God.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord did not set his love upon you,
nor choose you, <i>because ye were more in number than any
people</i>, <i>for</i> ye were the fewest of all people: in like
manner the population of this country was small in comparison
with that of many of the surrounding nations.&nbsp; The Jews were
selected that unto them might be &ldquo;committed the oracles of
God:&rdquo; so also this country appears to have been appointed,
by Providence, to preserve the holy Scriptures from
misinterpretation or perversion.&nbsp; The Jews were employed to
convey to the Gentiles some knowledge of the one true God: in
like manner this country appears to have been raised up to
diffuse amongst distant nations the light of the Gospel.&nbsp;
When grateful for Divine blessings, mindful of the Divine
government, and obedient to the Divine laws, the Jews were
abundantly blessed, and their wealth and greatness were far more
than commensurate with the extent of their territory; and the
resources of the kingdom: in like manner God has elevated this
country to a rank amongst the nations to which her native
dominions did not justify her aspiring.&nbsp; He has enriched her
with the treasures of the world, and has invested her with <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>an empire
upon which the sun never sets.&nbsp; So far the points of
agreement are striking on the bright side of the picture of
Jewish history; but there is also a dark side; let that also be
examined, to see if there can be discovered any shades of
resemblance.&nbsp; The Jews were thus exhorted and
warned:&mdash;&ldquo;When thou hast eaten and art full, <i>then
thou shalt bless</i> <span class="smcap">the Lord thy God</span>,
for the good land which <span class="smcap">He has given
thee</span>.&nbsp; Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God,
in not keeping His commandments, and His judgments, and His
statutes, which I command thee this day: lest when thou hast
eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt
therein: and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply; and thy
silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is
multiplied: <i>then thine heart be lifted up</i>, <i>and thou
forget the</i> <span class="smcap">Lord thy
God</span>,&mdash;<i>and thou say in thine heart</i>, <i>my power
and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth</i>.&nbsp;
<i>But thou shalt remember the</i> <span class="smcap">Lord thy
God</span>, <i>for it is</i> <span class="smcap">He that giveth
thee power</span> <i>to get wealth</i>.&nbsp; And it shall be if
thou do at all forget the Lord thy God, and walk after other
gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you
this day that <i>ye shall surely perish</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation107"></a><a href="#footnote107"
class="citation">[107]</a>&nbsp; Nor were they left in ignorance
as to what would be the ministers of Divine vengeance; unfruitful
seasons; and deadly pestilence; <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>and foreign invasion, with its
fearful attendants, the slaughter of the inhabitants, and the
devastation of their land, were all declared to be instruments,
in God&rsquo;s hand, to punish His ungrateful and rebellious
people.&nbsp; Nor did the fearful enumeration of judicial
inflictions stop there; they were forewarned of lengthened
sieges, of the most frightful extremity of famine, of long and
weary captivity in distant lands.&nbsp; Still there was reserved
for them,&mdash;if they would not know their day of
visitation,&mdash;a heavier, a more lasting and more terrible
punishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Lord</span>
<i>shall scatter thee among all people</i>, from the one end of
the earth even unto the other.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>And thou
shalt become an astonishment</i>, <i>a proverb</i>, <i>and a
by-word among all nations</i>, <i>whither the Lord shall lead
thee</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation108"></a><a href="#footnote108"
class="citation">[108]</a></p>
<p>The literal fulfilment of this prediction is matter of
history;&mdash;nay, more, the accomplishment of the last and most
terrible threat is matter of present experience; we have, unto
this day, the Jews scattered amongst all people, distinct in
religion, polity, and customs; unmingled with the population,
unincorporated in the institutions of the nations amongst whom
they sojourn: we see them a byword, a proverb, and an
astonishment, in every land: and can it be that we do not
discover in them a living memorial of the Divine government <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>of the
world, and of the Divine justice, which sooner or later overtakes
every nation, which does not recognise God&rsquo;s authority in
all things, and study to obey His laws.&nbsp; The condition of
the Jew speaks to the Christian the language of warning and
admonition: &ldquo;you possess privileges I once enjoyed: I
forfeited them by trusting to my own right arm, by forsaking God,
by not knowing the day of my visitation: take heed lest ye come
into the same state of condemnation; for it is God who ruleth in
Jacob, and unto the end of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let not the warning be addressed in vain: there are fearful
points of resemblance between this country and the Jews in the
darker side of their national character, when the chosen people
of the Lord.&nbsp; We are too much disposed &ldquo;to say in our
hearts, my power, and the might of my hand, hath gotten me this
wealth:&rdquo; and there is a love of the world, which falls
little short of idolatry;&mdash;there is a trusting to fortune,
and an ascribing events to chance and natural causes, which
almost amount to deifying fortune and nature.&nbsp; Let, then,
all the true servants of God, by their prayers, and their
labours, seek, in dependence on God&rsquo;s blessing, a remedy of
these great and growing evils.&nbsp; Let them appeal to the
experience of the past; let them prove from sacred history that
nations, which exalted themselves, have always been abased, which
humbled themselves, have always been exalted: let <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>them shew
from our own history how we have been blessed and preserved, and
how we have prospered and flourished, when our trust has been in
God, who alone &ldquo;<span class="smcap">is he that giveth
strength and power unto his people</span>: <span
class="smcap">blessed be God</span>!&rdquo; <a
name="citation110a"></a><a href="#footnote110a"
class="citation">[110a]</a>&nbsp; Let them bear public testimony
at once to the justice and mercy of His visitations; for whilst
the pestilence speaks the language of wrath: &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Woe to the rebellious children</span>, <span
class="smcap">saith the lord</span>, <span class="smcap">that
take counsel</span>, <span class="smcap">but not of me</span>,
and that cover with a covering, but not of My Spirit, that they
may add sin to sin:&rdquo; <a name="citation110b"></a><a
href="#footnote110b" class="citation">[110b]</a> it speaks also
the language of merciful warning and gracious exhortation:
&ldquo;As <span class="smcap">many as i love</span>, <span
class="smcap">i rebuke and chasten</span>: <span class="smcap">be
zealous</span>, <span class="smcap">therefore</span>, <span
class="smcap">and repent</span>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation110c"></a><a href="#footnote110c"
class="citation">[110c]</a></p>
<p>It has been stated, also, to be the duty of believers, to
employ every means in their power to eradicate all heretical and
infidel opinions; to advance a reformation of public morals; and
to promote the diffusion of true religion, sound learning, and
useful knowledge: which are all so dependent one upon another,
that they may be viewed in connexion, when considering the course
the faithful servants of the Lord are called upon to adopt, under
circumstances of almost unexampled difficulty, in this
country.&nbsp; Once more, let them be admonished, that their lot
is cast upon times which <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>require the highest degree of
energy, activity, zeal, and fidelity, in their Master&rsquo;s
service.&nbsp; Let no one imagine his station in life so low,
that he possesses no influence, nor consider his talents so small
that he can be of no use: much would be gained if the friends of
religion would all openly range themselves on the side of the
Lord; for such a demonstration of strength would overawe the
enemies of the faith.&nbsp; But how great would be the triumph if
all, whose hope is in the Lord&rsquo;s Christ, raised throughout
the land, their voice and hands in his most holy cause!&nbsp; The
fact cannot be mistaken&mdash;and to disguise it would be
culpable&mdash;that up to this time that decided movement has not
been made by the servants of the Lord, which the awful crisis at
which we have arrived so imperatively demands.&nbsp; Some appear
to look on, whilst a furious assault is made upon the Sion of our
God, with the heartless selfishness which says, &ldquo;it will
last my time;&rdquo; others gaze with a strange apathy; others,
bewildered with fear, know not how to act; and others seek only
to defend and preserve their own party and property, forgetful
that, if the common cause fail, they will be involved in the
common destruction.&nbsp; But the Church of Christ is built upon
a rock, &ldquo;and the gates of hell shall not prevail against
it.&rdquo; <a name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111"
class="citation">[111]</a>&nbsp; If the alarm were only sounded
generally through the kingdom, the cause of the <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>Lord would
not want defenders, both numerous and powerful, and the
discomfited emissaries of Satan would be driven from the
field.</p>
<p>Mankind are always disposed to close their eyes against
unpleasant objects,&mdash;to shut their ears against unwelcome
truths.&nbsp; Thus we are willing to be deceived: if we see evils
increasing, we still hope they are only partial and temporary; if
alarming reports reach us, we persuade ourselves that they must
be false or exaggerated.&nbsp; And if the danger become so near
as to menace our personal safety, such is the indolence,
weakness, and timidity of many, we often try to escape rather
than to combat, to avert rather than to overcome, even when we
know our only reasonable prospect of success is not in flight but
in resistance, not in making terms with, but in vanquishing the
enemy.&nbsp; The announcements, therefore, which have from time
to time been made of the increasing activity of the emissaries of
infidelity, and of the extensive circulation of sceptical,
profane, and blasphemous publications, appear to have been met by
the public at large either with indifference or incredulity; but
the prospect is now so alarming, the peril so imminent, that all
must rouse themselves, and acquit themselves like men, or they
may too late have to mourn the folly of incredulity, and the
sinfulness of indifference, when warned and appealed to in behalf
of religion.</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Let
not these observations be considered otherwise than as offered in
the spirit of a faithful discharge of duty: there is far from any
wish to create unnecessary alarm; there is a strong feeling that
to give uncalled-for admonition, would be presumptuous, and to
pass unmerited censure, would be criminal; but he who undertakes
to state the duty of a Christian people under a Divine
visitation, whilst he entreats and exhorts with all meekness, and
love, and reverence, must fearlessly pursue an impartial and
unprejudiced course; for terrible would be his condemnation if he
intentionally extenuated the evil or compromised the truth: he
would resemble the false teachers of old, who &ldquo;healed also
the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, <span
class="smcap">peace</span>, <span class="smcap">peace</span>,
<span class="smcap">when there is no peace</span>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation113"></a><a href="#footnote113"
class="citation">[113]</a></p>
<p>To prove, however, that these are neither the unauthorized
representations of mistaken views, nor the groundless creations
of false alarm, let the opinions of writers, as to the dangers
which threaten the cause of religion in this country, be
heard,&mdash;of writers, whose station and reputation entitle
them to respect.&nbsp; &ldquo;The signs of the times,&rdquo;
observes the Bishop of London, in his Charge of last year,
addressed to the clergy of his diocese,&mdash;&ldquo;the signs of
the times are surely such as to indicate to him who <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>attentively
observes the movements of God&rsquo;s providence, the approach,
if not the arrival of a period pregnant with important
consequences to the cause of religion.&nbsp; The spirit of
infidelity, which at the close of the last century unhinged the
frame of society, and overturned the altars of God in a
neighbouring country, but was repressed, and shamed, and put to
silence, by the Christian energies of this country, is again
rearing its head; and the truths of the Gospel are denied, and
its doctrines derided, and its blessed Author is reviled and
blasphemed by men whom the force of human laws has been found
unable to restrain.&nbsp; And if it be said that these are few in
number, and insignificant in point of talent and learning, there
is a more numerous class amongst us, who look upon religion
merely as a necessary part of every system of government; who
would introduce the principles of a miserable political economy
into its institutions and ministry; and who take no personal
interest in its consolations or its ordinances.&nbsp; And there
is also a powerful and active body of men who are attempting to
lay other foundations of the social virtues and duties than those
which are everlastingly laid in the Gospel, and to propose other
sanctions, and other rules of conduct, and other rewards, than
those which are proposed in the Word of Revelation.&rdquo; <a
name="citation114"></a><a href="#footnote114"
class="citation">[114]</a></p>
<p><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>The
Bishop of Durham, in his Charge, delivered during the autumn of
the present year, thus addresses his clergy:&mdash;&ldquo;Yet
while we would thus fain bury the past in oblivion, can we shut
our eyes to the existing dangers which beset us, from whatever
cause they may have arisen?&nbsp; Can we look around and see
Infidelity and Atheism on one side, Fanaticism on another; Popery
advancing in this direction, Socinianism in that; dissent,
lukewarmness, apathy, each with multitudes in its train, without
perceiving such an accession of strength to our adversaries, as
none of the present generation have ever before witnessed?&nbsp;
To exaggerate these evils, or to oppress the friends of religion
and social order with excessive apprehensions of danger, can
never be the policy of considerate men.&nbsp; But neither are we
justified in saying &lsquo;peace, peace,&rsquo; when there is no
peace; or in holding out illusory representations which every
discerning observer must perceive to be unfounded.&rdquo; <a
name="citation115"></a><a href="#footnote115"
class="citation">[115]</a></p>
<p>And after stating the &ldquo;duties to which we are now
indispensably called,&rdquo; the Bishop
continues:&mdash;&ldquo;that, in a Christian country like this,
and in so advanced a stage of mental cultivation, as is the boast
of the present day, it should be needful to press these
admonitions, is indeed grievous.&nbsp; And if we enquire how it
has become needful, the answer <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>is but too obvious.&nbsp; The main
root of the evil lies in a want of sound, sober, and practical
<i>religious</i> feeling; operating steadily throughout the
community, and influencing the conduct in all the various
departments of social life.&nbsp; The want of this is discernible
in attempts to carry on the work of <i>popular education</i>,
without teaching <i>religion</i> for its basis; in the systematic
and avowed separation of civil and political from
<i>Christian</i> obligations; in the disposition to consider all
truths, on whatever <i>sacred authority</i> they may rest, as
matters of mere <i>human opinion</i>; and in a persuasion that
the whole concern of government, of legislation, and of social
order, may be conducted as if there were no <span
class="smcap">moral ruler of the universe</span> controlling the
destinies of men or of nations: no other responsibilities than
those which subsist between man and man, unamenable to a higher
tribunal.&nbsp; So long as these pernicious sentiments obtain
currency amongst us, (and who will say that they do not fearfully
prevail in every rank and every station?) it is impossible for
any believer in a righteous Providence not to look on such a
state of things with unwonted misgivings.&rdquo; <a
name="citation116"></a><a href="#footnote116"
class="citation">[116]</a></p>
<p>The statements as to the number, power, and malignity of the
enemies of religion, made by these two Prelates, supply the
powerfully sketched out <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>line of a terrible picture, which
becomes still more terrific when filled up with the details which
may be derived from other sources.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is another
subject,&rdquo; says an able writer, in the British Critic,
&ldquo;which gives us, we confess, more uneasiness, and becomes
every day more difficult and painful, and that is the renewed and
increasing efforts made by scoffers and infidels, not only in our
country, but others, to profit by the disturbed state of the
public mind, and to disseminate as widely as possible their
infernal poison amongst the needy, the ignorant, and the
profligate; at once goading them to cruel disorders and excess,
and robbing them of all hope of an hereafter.&nbsp; It cannot be
known, excepting to those who make it their business to enquire,
what pains, and patience, and ingenuity, are now bestowed upon
this accursed work.&nbsp; Infidel books, and infidel teachers, we
have always had; but certainly there never was a moment when the
art of corrupting the minds of the people was carried to so high
a pitch, or exercised with so much effrontery; nor ever were the
fruits of it so frightfully conspicuous.&nbsp; It is revolting to
think of them, and it were a task to make the heart sick to
detail them; but it may suffice to state, that besides the public
discourses which are delivered almost daily by the great masters
of the school in the Rotunda, and in other places amongst the
crowded outskirts of the metropolis, <i>for the avowed specific
purpose of advocating </i><a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span><i>the cause of infidelity</i>, it
is a well known fact, that blasphemous and profane lectures are
delivered three times a week, in the City itself, to large
audiences of labourers and artizans, after their daily task is
done, from each of whom a penny a piece is collected, under the
head of infidel rent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor is the press behind-hand with them in their course:
for whilst numerous hawkers and other emissaries scatter
unsparingly in lanes and alleys their pennyworths of profanation,
the great emporium blazons forth its more elaborate blasphemies
with fresh spirit, in characters which those who run may
read&mdash;a standing monument of its interminable hostility to
the Gospel, and of the utter hopelessness of all legal measures
to restrain it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the account laid before the public in the beginning
of this year, of a scheme, skilfully planned, and actively
conducted, for corrupting the religious principles of the working
population of the country, and thus paving the way for the ruin
of social order, and the subversion of civil society.&nbsp; Since
then the strong arm of the law has seized upon the arch infidel,
but his murky den still remains: the Rotunda is said to be made
the scene of more horrible impieties than ever; and the great
work of teaching and disseminating infidelity, though more
covertly, is equally extensively carried on.</p>
<p>We possess, then, certain information, supplied by these and
various other distinguished writers, as <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>to the two
facts&mdash;the progress of a secret undermining of the influence
of Christianity now going forward in the middle and higher
classes of society; and in the lower, of an organized system of
open and violent aggression, not merely upon the principles of
religion, but the decencies of life.&nbsp; Surely this should
fill with alarm and rouse to exertion all who fear God and love
their country; for the preservation of the national faith is
essential to the continuance of national and individual happiness
and prosperity.&nbsp; Before, however, examining further into
these frightful evils, and offering some suggestions as to the
course believers should adopt, let an enquiry be made as to their
probable influence upon the moral state of the great bulk of the
people.</p>
<p>Degeneracy of public morals must always necessarily follow
corruption of public principles.&nbsp; As soon might you expect
to draw pure water from a polluted fountain, as virtuous actions
from unsound principles.&nbsp; Remove the restraint of
conscience, and what does man become? a fickle and wicked being,
of wild passions, selfish feelings, and ungovernable appetites:
he has lost the ruling principle which regulated and directed his
actions; and thus resembles a boat without rudder or oars, tost
upon a stormy sea, which, impelled in different directions as the
winds, tides, or currents happen to prevail, possesses neither
certainty of direction nor steadiness of course.</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>It is
true, when the law of God ceases to be the rule of right, men
profess to substitute for it the law of honour and the law of the
land.&nbsp; But to ascertain the value of the law of honour as
the guide of life, let some of the cases of daily occurrence be
observed, in which the rights of hospitality have been abused
with shameless unconcern, the confidence of friendship repaid
with base ingratitude, and the dearest ties of life broken with
base and heartless exultation, by men of honour.&nbsp; Words
cannot express the load of deep, of agonizing woe, which the
partial substitution of the law of honour for the law of God has
inflicted upon this Christian land.&nbsp; Families, through it,
have had to suffer privations from the extravagance, and poverty
from the gambling of parents; to weep for the untimely death of a
father by the hand of the duellist; to mourn and blush for the
indelible stain of a mother&rsquo;s shame.</p>
<p>Such are some of the terrible effects of the law of honour, as
the guide of life, which, if it sanction not, tolerates the
betrayal of innocence, the ruin of a family, and the murder of a
fellow-creature.</p>
<p>Let an inquiry be now made into the value of the law of the
land as a rule of right.&nbsp; Here the records of our courts of
justice might suffice to shew, that severe laws do not deter from
the commission of crime.&nbsp; This is as might be fairly
calculated upon; because the fear of uncertain or distant
punishment, will never operate as an effectual restraint <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>upon an
unprincipled mind: it is not, that the law is without its terrors
to offenders, but it is, that under the influence of some
powerful inducement, the salutary effect of those terrors is
lost, from their being viewed at a distance, from the hope of
escaping detection, and from the power of present
temptation.&nbsp; These observations regard principally more
heinous offences; but if the effect of the criminal code be found
to be, that it operates more for the punishment than the
prevention of crime, what would be the state of society, if the
civil law was our great guide in transactions between man and
man.</p>
<p>If careful only to keep within its enactments, we made
inclination or interest our guide, where would be all the kind
offices of Christian charity, where the interchange of friendly
services, where the joys of Christian sympathy.&nbsp; Sad,
indeed, would be the change, if, making the law of the land his
sole rule of right, man, naturally weak, selfish, and sensual,
gave the reins to his desires, and sought only his personal
gratifications.&nbsp; There might, indeed, be some exceptions,
but the general rule would be, &ldquo;let us eat and drink, for
to-morrow we die.&rdquo;&nbsp; In illustration of this view of
the probable effects of such a system upon society, let the case
of a litigious man be supposed: what annoyance, what ill-will,
what animosities, does his vexatious enforcement of the law, in
the most minute particulars, <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>often excite in a neighbourhood: but
if, in addition to his being litigious, he be also
irreligious,&mdash;if he be without a belief in a future state, a
judgment to come, and final rewards or punishments&mdash;what a
fearful aggravation of the evils at once takes place: suppose,
however, further, that it is not the spirit, but the letter of
the law he regards; nay, more, that it is only its punishments he
fears; and that he breaks the law, whenever secrecy affords hope
of escape, or the weakness of the party injured, chance of
impunity: what a pest to society would he be!&mdash;And yet,
however odious and disgusting the picture, such would the great
bulk of mankind become, if they could be once brought to consider
conscience a bug-bear, and Christianity an imposture.</p>
<p>What is it restrains appetites, the indulgence of which
produces so much misery?&mdash;Christianity.&nbsp; What is it
subdues the desire of revenge, which thirsts for
blood?&mdash;Christianity.&nbsp; What is it arrests the course of
secret crime?&mdash;Christianity.&nbsp; What is it expands the
contracted views and wishes of selfishness, and unlocks the
sympathies of cold uncharitableness?&mdash;Christianity.&nbsp;
Have the law of honour, or the law of the land, power to produce
such mighty effects?&nbsp; They even lay not claim to such a
power.&nbsp; But the benefits of Christianity stop not
here.&nbsp; It is true, its transforming power, when its
hallowing influence is fully felt, is the grandest phenomenon of
<a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>the
moral world:&mdash;&ldquo;the wicked are like the troubled sea,
when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt:&rdquo;
<a name="citation123"></a><a href="#footnote123"
class="citation">[123]</a> but above the storm, a voice is
heard&mdash;the command is uttered,&mdash;&ldquo;Peace, be
still!&rdquo; the winds of passion are hushed, the waves of
appetite subside, and a holy calm reigns in the mind and
heart.&nbsp; Still, the power of Christianity, heaven&rsquo;s
best gift to man, produces other benefits.&nbsp; It heals all the
wounds which physical and moral evils cause to poor human
nature.&nbsp; It soothes the pain of sickness, it lightens the
pressure of privation, it cheers the sorrows of affliction; and,
at that awful hour, when human aid is unavailing, and when the
soul, trembling on the brink of eternity, can repose only on the
firm stay of eternal truth, it administers solid comfort,
supplies pious confidence, and whispers holy peace.&mdash;A dying
hour is a severe test of principles; and it is at that hour,
which unmasks hypocrisy, and proves the weakness of philosophy,
the power of genuine Christianity is clearly seen:&mdash;it is at
that hour, when all the world seeks for as happiness, is found to
be vanity, all it calls glory, fades into insignificance, its
value is fully felt; it is at that hour, when a recollection of
past sins, long forsaken and repented of, is present to the
humble and contrite, and a consciousness of extreme unworthiness
afflicts the soul which still confides in Jesus, its victory is
complete.</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>Well
might Bishop Watson ask Gibbon, &ldquo;Suppose the mighty work
accomplished, the cross trampled upon, Christianity every where
proscribed, and the religion of nature once more become the
religion of Europe; what advantage will you have derived to your
country or to yourselves from the exchange?&mdash;I will tell you
from what you will have freed the world; you will have freed it
from its abhorrence of vice, and from every powerful incentive to
virtue; you will, with the religion, have brought back the
depraved morality of Paganism: you will have robbed mankind of
their firm assurance of another life; and thereby you will have
despoiled them of their patience, of their humility, of their
charity, of their chastity, of all those mild and silent virtues
which, (however despicable they may appear in your eyes) are the
only ones which meliorate and sublime our nature; which Paganism
never knew, which spring from Christianity alone.&rdquo; <a
name="citation124"></a><a href="#footnote124"
class="citation">[124]</a>&nbsp; Nor does this able writer, in
his Letters to Paine, state less clearly and forcibly the evils
which the infidel school inflict upon society.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
accomplishing your purpose you will have unsettled the faith of
thousands; rooted from the minds of the unhappy virtuous all
their comfortable assurance of a future recompense; have
annihilated, in the minds of the flagitious, all their fears of
future <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>punishment; you will have given the reins to the
domination of every passion; and have thereby contributed to the
introduction of the public insecurity, and the private
unhappiness usually, and almost necessarily, accompanying a state
of corrupted morals.&rdquo; <a name="citation125"></a><a
href="#footnote125" class="citation">[125]</a></p>
<p>Would that the anti-christian school of this day could be
induced to forego their unwearied exertions to make proselytes,
by considering the poor substitute they have to offer for an holy
faith, which is the hope of the prosperous, the consolation of
the afflicted, the comfort of the sick, and the support of the
dying!&nbsp; To man, who feels his want of some holy light to
guide his erring steps, some blessed solace to cheer an aching
heart, in a world of perplexity and woe, the infidel has nothing
to offer but the laws, for the guidance of his public conduct,
and for his internal monitor and comforter,&mdash;a poor
philosophy.&nbsp; But what to teach him how to die?&nbsp;
Nothing: for he has nothing to offer but the trite aphorisms of
heathen philosophers.&nbsp; What to take away the fear of
something after death?&nbsp; Nothing: for he who believes nothing
which Christianity has revealed can know nothing of a state of
future existence, uncognizable by unassisted reason.</p>
<p>Miserable men! the Christian mourns over the wilful blindness
which, in the full blaze of the meridian <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>sun,
continues in darkness, a state which is but a faint emblem of
&ldquo;the blackness of darkness for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; Most
guilty men! the Christian burns with holy indignation against
their perverted and wicked zeal for proselytism, of whom it may
be said, &ldquo;Ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte,
and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell
than yourselves.&rdquo; <a name="citation126"></a><a
href="#footnote126" class="citation">[126]</a>&nbsp; If the
infidel reflects, what must be his state of mind, when he
remembers, how often, whilst feeling the utter wretchedness of
his dark and cheerless creed, he has sought with artful sophistry
to bewilder the understandings of the ignorant, and, with cold
heartlessness, to blast the hopes of the virtuous!&nbsp; He who
openly stabs or secretly poisons an associate, incurs a less load
of moral guilt than he who inflicts a wound or instils a poison,
which, rankling, causes misery in this life, and in the next,
anguish unutterable and interminable.</p>
<p>Fatal, however, as such a creed must be to the best interests
of society, wherever its influence prevails, it assumes a still
more alarming aspect as inculcated by those infidel teachers,
who, disseminating their pestilent doctrines amongst our working
population, not only seek to destroy all the hopes and fears of
an hereafter, but to stimulate their evil passions, and to
produce a contempt not <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>less for human than Divine
laws.&nbsp; If once principles so subversive of the civil and
religious obligations of man, as a member of a Christian
community, were allowed gradually to leaven the great mass of the
population; not only would the cause of religion and morals be
deeply injured, but eventually the altars of God would be
overthrown, the bonds of civil society broken, and anarchy,
spoliation, and bloodshed, reign through the land.&nbsp; With the
great bulk of mankind, the sense of responsibility, present and
future, is the great restraint upon their evil
inclinations.&nbsp; Philosophers may talk of the eternal fitness
of things, the beauty of virtue, the value of the distinctions of
rank, of unequal divisions of property, and the necessity of
order, subordination, and industry, for the well-being of
society: but once remove from the minds of the lower classes
their fear of punishment,&mdash;by destroying all belief in a
future state of retribution, and all dread of the laws of the
land, the execution of which they overawe, defeat, or defy, by
their numbers,&mdash;and there will be confusion, aggression,
outrage, and a general attack upon property.&nbsp; Constituted as
man is by nature, and constituted as society is by law and
custom, in a Christian country, as soon as Revelation is rejected
by the great bulk of the people, the work of disorder and
disorganization must be rapidly carried on, until the whole
frame-work of society be broken up.</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>The
grand principle by which society is held together, in a free
country, is religious and moral influence controlling and
directing physical force to the good of the whole
community.&nbsp; Emancipate physical force from the salutary
restraints and guidance by which its violence and turbulence are
checked, and its mighty energies beneficially directed and
employed, and the same results will ensue, as would occur, were
that mighty engine,&mdash;the proudest boast of modern
science,&mdash;the steam-engine, deprived of the nice adjustments
and counterbalances which have rendered its formidable powers of
easy, safe, and useful application.&nbsp; The frightful
destruction which attends the explosion of a steam-engine, would
be more than paralleled by the sudden rending asunder of the
bands of society, when physical force, released from the
government of religious and moral influence, bursts forth with
the full sweep of its tremendous powers.&nbsp; Abstract
principles, and philosophical theories, weigh not a feather with
the great bulk of mankind, who are far more under the direction
of their passions than their judgment.&nbsp; Suppose the case of
one man rich,&mdash;and it may be, possessing more than he
appears to require,&mdash;surrounded by many who are poor and
needy.&nbsp; What prevents the many from plundering the one? not
abstract principles of natural justice, not a philosophical
respect for the rights of property, but regard for Divine and
human <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>laws: remove the restraints of conscience, and the fear
of punishment, and the many poor will rush upon the rich few,
like a pack of hungry wolves upon, scattered and defenceless
sheep.</p>
<p>This admits of easy proof: it is an undeniable axiom in
morals, that vice brings with it its own punishment; how then
does it come to pass that it abounds to such a fearful extent in
society?&nbsp; It needs not any very extensive acquaintance with
life to return the answer, which appears to be the true
one,&mdash;that where there is not religious principle the truths
of morality are less powerful than the impulses of passion, and
present gratification is willingly purchased, even at the expense
of much after suffering.&nbsp; Suppose, then, both religion and
morals discarded; and man left, not merely to the unrestrained
indulgence of his evil passions, but those passions excited by
intoxicating and maddening stimulants, what then would be the
consequences?&nbsp; The heart sickens whilst the mind pictures to
itself some of the frightful excesses, the horrible enormities,
of which one man may be capable under such circumstances.&nbsp;
Suppose, further, not one man only, but a large proportion of the
labouring population of a country exposed to the artful and
wicked devices of infidel and seditious demagogues, corrupting
the principles, by profane and blasphemous writings; exciting
angry and vindictive feelings by exaggerated or false tales <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>of
injustice and wrong; fostering hatred and malignity towards the
rich, by representing them as the oppressors and robbers of the
poor, by whose labour they live; and stimulating their natural
cupidity and sensuality by hopes of plunder, of ease, and of
enjoyment; what, then, would be the consequences?&nbsp; Let the
history of France return the answer, for it is written in
characters of blood, in her annals, when, through the influence
of a party, at first small, and apparently contemptible, she
became revolutionised, demoralised, unchristianised.&nbsp; Birth,
rank, and wealth, were alone sufficient to expose their
possessors to democratic violence and fury; when all laws, human
and Divine, broken,&mdash;all institutions, civil and religious,
overturned, regicide and apostate France subverted the throne,
and trampled upon the cross; and the demons of disorder,
spoliation, and butchery, stalked through her land, deluged with
the best blood of her children.</p>
<p>The conclusion, then, at which the impartial and dispassionate
enquirer will arrive,&mdash;a conclusion which has received the
terrible sanction of experience,&mdash;is, that the most horrible
consequences will result to society when physical force is
released from the salutary restraints of religious and moral
influence.</p>
<p>When unchristianised, man becomes a sort of demon: he riots in
the licentiousness of his assumed <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>freedom from obligations Divine and
human; and if leagued in a diabolical conspiracy against
religion, laws, and property,&mdash;against all that is virtuous,
noble, and praiseworthy,&mdash;he is involved as he advances,
deeper and deeper in danger and guilt; as the crisis approaches,
he is impelled forward in his headlong career, with a rapidity
which allows no time for reflection, with a force which defies
resistance, until at last he is swallowed up in the wide ruin of
universal tumult and disorder: like one who commits himself to
the guidance of a stream, ignorant or regardless of the distant
cataract, towards which it is flowing: borne along by its
powerful current, he is, at first, delighted with his swift and
unchecked progress, but as he proceeds, the rapidity and force of
the stream fearfully increase, until at last, drawn within the
full influence of the fall, he is swept along with tremendous
violence towards the verge of precipitation, whence he shoots
into the boiling gulf below&mdash;a gulf which is no unfit emblem
of society, heaving, foaming, and roaring, under the domination
of physical force.</p>
<p>Let not, however, the useful and awful lesson which the French
revolution teaches be thus hastily dismissed: human nature is
always the same, and similar causes will produce similar results,
however modified by circumstances.&nbsp; A length of time was
required in that country to sow the seeds of infidelity, but as
soon as they had taken deep root in <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>the public mind, their effects were
apparent; their growth was as rapid as it was luxuriant, and they
bore such a deadly crop as fills the mind with disgust and
horror.&nbsp; Nor was the field of operation of the antichristian
conspiracy confined to France, the great object of which was,
every where to accomplish the defamation and discredit of the
Christian religion, where it could not effect its entire
overthrow.</p>
<p>Let the portrait, therefore, be examined which Bishop Horsley
has supplied us with of those times, which must be still fresh in
the recollection of some; it is drawn with the power and effect
of a master in his art; would it were only interesting as a vivid
sketch by a contemporary, of dangers passed away! it speaks even
now with a warning voice to this country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole of Europe, with the exception of France only,
and those miserable countries which France has fraternized, is
yet nominally Christian: but for the last thirty years or more,
we have seen in every part of it but little correspondence
between the lives of men and their professions; a general
indifference about the doctrines of Christianity; a general
neglect of its duties; no reverent observance of its rites.&nbsp;
The centre from which the mischief has spread is France.&nbsp; In
that kingdom the mystery of iniquity began to work somewhat
earlier than the middle of the century which is just passed <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>away.&nbsp;
Its machinations at first were secret, unperceived,
disguised.&nbsp; Its instruments were persons in no conspicuous
stations.&nbsp; But by the persevering zeal of an individual,
who, by an affectation of a depth of universal learning which he
never possessed&mdash;by audacity in the circulation of what he
knew to be falsified history&mdash;by a counterfeit zeal for
toleration; but above all, by a certain brilliancy of
unprincipled wit, contrived to acquire a celebrity for his name,
and a deference to his opinions, far beyond the proportion of
what might be justly due either to his talents or attainments,
though neither the one nor the other were
inconsiderable;&mdash;by the persevering zeal, I say, of this
miscreant, throughout a long, though an infirm and sickly life of
bold active impiety, a conspiracy was formed of all the wit, the
science, the philosophy, and the politics, not of France only,
but of many other countries, for the extirpation of the Christian
name.&nbsp; The art, the industry, the disguise, the deep-laid
policy with which the nefarious plot was carried on; the numbers
of all ranks and descriptions which were drawn in to take part in
it&mdash;men of letters first, then magistrates, nobles,
ministers of state, sovereign princes: last of all, the inferior
ranks, merchants, attornies, bankers&rsquo; clerks, tradesmen,
mechanics, peasants; the eagerness with which, under the
direction of their chief, all these contributed their power,
their influence, their ingenuity, their <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>industry,
their labour, in their respective situations and occupations in
life, to the advancement of the one great object of the
confederacy, are facts that are indeed astonishing.&rdquo; <a
name="citation134a"></a><a href="#footnote134a"
class="citation">[134a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The success of this vast enterprise of impiety was
beyond any thing that could have been expected by any but the
first projector, from the littleness of its beginnings.&rdquo; <a
name="citation134b"></a><a href="#footnote134b"
class="citation">[134b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;The apostacy of the
French nation, and the subversion of the Gallican Church, however
unexpected at the time in Europe, was not a sudden event: it was
not one of those spontaneous revolutions in public opinion which
are to be traced to no definite beginning, to no certain cause:
it was not the effect of any real grievance of the people,
proceeding as hath been falsely pretended, from the rapacity and
the ambition of their clergy: it was the catastrophe and
accomplishment of a premeditated plot&mdash;a plot conceived in
mere malice, carried on with steady, unrelenting malignity, for
half a century.&rdquo; <a name="citation134c"></a><a
href="#footnote134c" class="citation">[134c]</a></p>
<p>Such is the account which one of the ablest writers England
ever produced has left behind him, of the origin and progress of
a conspiracy against Christianity, the effects of which he also
witnessed in this country, but by the blessing of God on the
labours of himself and others, lived to see happily
counteracted.&nbsp; There is much, it is true, which <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>does not
correspond with the aspect of the present times; with which,
however, a very superficial acquaintance will satisfy every
enquiring mind that there is also much which applies to them too
well.&nbsp; It is not likely that the operations of infidelity
will be precisely the same at different periods, though the
object remains unaltered: still even in their plans and
machinery, there will often be found great resemblance.&nbsp; The
infidel scheme in France was commenced by men of letters; in this
country at present, its most open and fierce advocates are
amongst the low and half-educated classes: still we have seen
that in the middle and higher classes there is gaining ground not
&ldquo;a direct attack on the evidences of Christianity or on the
value of its doctrines;&rdquo; but &ldquo;the distinctive
character of modern unbelief is the attempt to supersede
Christianity, and to make men moral without its guiding and
restraining influence.&rdquo; <a name="citation135"></a><a
href="#footnote135" class="citation">[135]</a>&nbsp; There is
here a much greater resemblance than might be at first supposed,
between the two plans of operation, now and at the close of the
last century.&nbsp; The attack was then made with the most
masterly skill: care was taken that the prejudices of education,
as they were considered, should at first be treated with
tenderness; and the way gradually prepared for the reception of
opinions, which, if at once presented to the <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>uncorrupted
mind, would have been rejected with horror.&nbsp; To use an
illustration in perfect accordance with their views, the light of
impiety was to be gradually let in upon an eye, which had long
been clouded by the cataract of superstition, lest it should
prefer the darkness of error to the full blaze of truth.&nbsp; We
find, therefore, no premature development of immoral and impious
doctrines: superstition, bigotry, intolerance, were strongly
condemned; clerical abuses and exactions fiercely inveighed
against; but pure religion and morality were commended.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In this country,&rdquo; writes Horseley, &ldquo;I believe
they know very well that bold undisguised atheism, proceeding
directly and openly to its horrid purpose, will never be
successful.&nbsp; They must have recourse, therefore, to cautious
stratagem; they must pretend that their object is not to
demolish, but reform: and it was with a view of giving colour to
this pretence, that the impudent lie&mdash;for such I have proved
it to be&mdash;has been propagated in this country of their
reverence for pure Christianity, and for the
Reformation.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there was one invariable feature of
all their proceedings, never lost sight of, a rancorous and
malignant hostility to the established Church; and unwearied
exertions &ldquo;to alienate the minds of the people from the
established clergy, by representing them as sordid worldlings,
without any concern about the souls of men, indifferent to the
religion <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>which they ought to teach, to which the laity are
attached, and destitute of the Spirit of God.&rdquo; <a
name="citation137a"></a><a href="#footnote137a"
class="citation">[137a]</a>&nbsp; Here, then, we have a direct
parallel between those times and the present, in which, indeed,
the balance of evil is against us, for, &ldquo;the Church of
England,&rdquo; observes a living prelate, <a
name="citation137b"></a><a href="#footnote137b"
class="citation">[137b]</a> &ldquo;never, perhaps, hitherto has
had to contend with so great a number of open and avowed enemies;
who, in their reiterated and persevering attacks, stop short of
no misrepresentations, however flagrant, which tend to hold it up
to public scorn and indignation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After making every allowance, indeed, for the popular
excitement, which may be of only temporary duration; for the
resentful feelings, which may pass away with the occasion which
has excited them; still there remains sufficient to justify the
worst apprehensions, and to demand the most strenuous exertions
at counteraction of the friends of order and religion.&nbsp; It
is not merely that there is a want of veneration, love and value
for the Church; but a rancorous hatred, spurred on by eager
desire of spoliation, is manifested, wherever infidel teachers
have made proselytes to their wicked creed.&nbsp; Respect, also,
for constituted authorities, is destroyed, by their inculcating
the audacious falsehood, that civil government has been framed,
to enable the few to rule <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>the many.&nbsp; Value for the laws
has been lessened, by their declaring, there is one law for the
rich, and another for the poor.&nbsp; And the bonds of affection
and kind offices, which united the pastor and the parishioner,
the landlord and the tenant, have been almost every where
weakened, and in some places broken, by more than the base
insinuation, by the assertion, that the forbearance and kindness
shown, originate not in friendly regard and Christian charity,
but in the ignoble wish of buying golden opinions,&mdash;in the
pusillanimous desire of propitiating men roused to a sense of
their injuries,&mdash;of disarming of their angry passions men
panting for retaliation and revenge.&nbsp; Thus the force of the
public and social obligations of life has been impaired, and
those kind ties and sympathies, which bind man to man in their
several relations, are converted by the poison of infidel
principles, into food for malignant feelings, which inwardly
rankle in the heart, and which outwardly evince themselves by
discontent, distrust, and dislike; and when the opportunity
presents itself, by violence, aggression, and outrage.&nbsp; The
effects of such a state of things, if not counteracted, cannot be
contemplated, without the most painful apprehension, for, as it
has been powerfully expressed, &ldquo;fatal must be the
consequences, if the monstrous fiends of blasphemy and
disorganization now going about seeking whom they may devour, and
stalking <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>openly through the land, with menace and defiance, be
suffered to take undisturbed possession of our peasants and
artificers, or of those on whom they immediately depend for their
support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have already seen the system of extensive combinations
carried on in defiance of the laws;&mdash;organized bands and
tumultuous assemblages of peasantry, extorting money, and
enforcing their demands with threats of violence;&mdash;wanton
destruction of property, in the breaking of machinery, in attacks
upon private houses, and in the far more horrible crime of the
nocturnal incendiary;&mdash;violence and excesses in many
towns;&mdash;and riot, pillage, and arson, defying for some days,
in a great city, municipal authorities and military force.</p>
<p>Now when all these fearful evils are viewed in connection with
the general increase of crime, more particularly of juvenile
delinquency; with the abuse and profanation of the sabbath, and
neglect of the public ordinances of religion, and with the
unsound views in faith and morals which extensively
prevail&mdash;the shades of the gloomy picture gradually
darken.&nbsp; But it is capable of receiving some further tints,
and then the moral state of the kingdom, which has been
studiously kept as far as possible distinct from the political,
will stand forth, it is believed, under such an appalling aspect
as to satisfy men, of all parties, of the necessity of prompt and
vigorous exertion, of strong and efficient remedies.&nbsp; <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>Amongst the
great body of the people have sprung up contempt for antiquity,
disregard for established usages, disrespect for rank, love of
innovation, clamorous discontent, and fierce desire of change,
which impel them forward with blind and presumptuous confidence
in their own wisdom, and with reckless indifference as to what
may be the consequences of their precipitation and
rashness.&nbsp; The public press, which exercises a fearful
despotism&mdash;and political leaders, whose authority is
scarcely less absolute&mdash;urge forward an already over-excited
people, instead of attempting to allay the rising storm which
threatens to involve all in the common ruin of social order,
public property, and national credit.</p>
<p>The urgent importance of the question, What is to be done?
cannot but force itself upon the attention of the most
supine&mdash;of the most indifferent to their country&rsquo;s
safety and welfare; and surely only one answer can be
returned&mdash;repair any injuries which time may have caused to
the goodly edifice of the Church, or to the fair fabric of the
Constitution, striving, at the same time, by a general diffusion
of true religion, sound learning, and useful knowledge, to secure
the eradication of heretical and infidel opinions, and the
reformation of public morals; and by the blessing of God, the
storm will pass away, and leave the Church and Constitution
unscathed.&nbsp; True Christian wisdom <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>revolts
from any concession of principle, but not less so from any
defence of error; it yields not to popular clamour and threats in
matters of duty, but it thankfully receives the admonition given
in the spirit of kindness, and profits even by the warning of an
enemy, to remove any slight blemishes, which, affecting not the
foundation of the Church built on a rock, appear externally, and
tempt the rash and rude hand of bold and unhallowed
reparation.</p>
<p>It is the height of political wisdom to know when to refuse,
and when to concede popular claims.&nbsp; To refuse just claims
is equally wicked and unwise; it is not only an act of injustice,
as debarring the people from their rights, but it destroys
confidence and respect&mdash;it produces fierce discontent,
exasperation, and vindictiveness towards their rulers; and, in
the end, if the claimants be powerful, that is extorted as a
right which was first asked as a boon.&nbsp; To concede unfounded
claims is equally weak and unwise; it stimulates the eager and
grasping spirit of demand, it rarely conciliates for the time,
but never satisfies; it causes that unsettled expecting and
excited state of the public mind so unfavourable to national
contentment, happiness, and prosperity; and if the system be long
continued&mdash;and every new concession, by weakening the
strength of the yielding party, will make it more difficult to
change the system&mdash;security after security, privilege <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>after
privilege having been surrendered, the petitioners will become
the framers of the laws&mdash;the claimants, the dispensers of
privileges&mdash;the governed, the governing power in the
kingdom.&nbsp; At the awful crisis at which we have arrived it is
the bounden duty of all men to forget party distinctions, to
divest themselves of party spirit, to have no object in view but
the honour of God and the general good.&nbsp; Let, therefore, the
claims of the people be dispassionately and impartially weighed;
not, however, abstractedly, but with relation to the general
good; and let these claims be conceded so far as they may be
granted consistently with the rights of property, the integrity
of the constitution, the interests of religion, and the welfare
of the empire.&nbsp; And having made every concession which
justice demands, and which the real interests not only of the
claimants, but of society at large, sanction, let the whole
energies of government and the nation be directed to crushing the
seditious and blasphemous associations which are actively
employed in exciting discontent and insubordination, and in
corrupting the principles of our agricultural and manufacturing
population; and let every means be employed to calm the agitation
of the public mind&mdash;to restore it to that peaceful,
healthful, and contented state, which once so much distinguished
the people of England.</p>
<p>To effect, however, this great object, the co-operation <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>of that
mighty engine of good or evil&mdash;the public press, is
essential.&nbsp; When the information, the talent, the eloquence,
which are so conspicuous in many of our leading journals are
considered, we cease to wonder at the immense influence they
possess over the public mind; for partly through indolence,
partly through ignorance, a large proportion of men are disposed
to adopt, without examination, opinions which come recommended by
the authority of a name they have been accustomed to respect and
value.&nbsp; How beneficial, then, would be the consequences to
society, if the public press would use more moderation; if
instead of swelling the storm which is raging through the land,
it would pour oil upon the heaving and troubled waters; if,
instead of advocating the interests of a party, the public good
was made of paramount importance.&nbsp; It is melancholy to
observe the pernicious influence of party spirit upon the public
press of this country: it is not only that it excites rancour and
bitterness of feeling, but even truth, viewed through the medium
of its jaundiced eye, appears like falsehood&mdash;beauty, like
deformity&mdash;virtue, like vice.&nbsp; Of this we have at
present a too complete proof in the misrepresentations, the
misstatements, the calumnies, which have been directed against
the Established Church.&nbsp; The writers cannot be so ignorant
as not to know the charges are substantially false,&mdash;they
cannot be so dishonest as <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>to give circulation to what they
know to be untrue, and therefore, as they publish the most false
and calumnious allegations against the Clergy, it can only be,
that the mists of party distort objects,&mdash;the prejudices of
party misconstrue motives,&mdash;the spirit of party perverts
facts.&nbsp; Let it not be said that the liberty of the press has
degenerated into such licentiousness, that many public journals
have willingly and premeditatedly been guilty of the monstrous
wickedness of traducing and vilifying, and holding up to public
scorn and reprobation, the Clergy of the Established Church, but
rather that, under the delirium of a political fever, they have
unconsciously loaded with unmerited opprobrium, and most unjustly
held up to public odium, the Clergy, who, as a body, are
distinguished for their talents, their learning, their piety, and
their zeal in their Great Master&rsquo;s holy cause.</p>
<p>A deep debt of justice remains due to the Established Church;
and to the sense of right, and to the good feelings of those who
have joined in the cry against it, this appeal is made.&nbsp;
There is not any disposition on the part of the Clergy to ask for
undue favour or commendation:&mdash;no wish, that abuses, if they
exist, should be spared,&mdash;that delinquency, if any case
occur, should escape punishment.&nbsp; But they protest against
the manifest injustice with which they have been treated.&nbsp;
The most extravagant over-statements of a few valuable <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>appointments have been industriously circulated, as a
proof of excessive and overgrown wealth, whilst the poverty of
some high dignities, and a large proportion of benefices, has
been studiously kept back; the failings and offences of a few
individuals, under every form of exaggeration and perversion,
have been dwelt and enlarged upon with evident satisfaction,
whilst no just meed of praise has been bestowed upon the body, to
which rather the censure, due only to some few members, has
ingeniously, but wickedly, been made to attach.&nbsp; All which
misrepresentations apparently have in view one object,&mdash;that
the charges of excessive wealth and extreme worthlessness may
stimulate and justify spoliation and subversion.&nbsp; And yet no
angry recriminations, scarcely any indignant remonstrances, have
issued from the injured party: when they have spoken, it has been
in the calm language of conscious rectitude; and the great body
have forborn to reply to insult and invective, relying on the
goodness of their cause, to which they feel assured the people of
England will, sooner or later, do full justice.&nbsp; If aught
could soften the harsh severity, could shame the cruel injustice
with which the Clergy have been censured, vilified, and
persecuted, surely it should be the Christian meekness and
patience with which they have borne the heavy load of wrong that
has been cast upon them.&nbsp; Full many there are who, unmoved
by clamour, <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>unprovoked by injuries, and unappalled by dangers, are
pursuing the even tenor of their way, in the diligent and
faithful discharge of their sacred duties.&nbsp; But silence
under grievous charges is often interpreted into an admission of
their truth, and meekness under heavy reproaches a proof of their
justice.&nbsp; There are times, therefore, when the Clergy should
raise their voice in self-vindication; not merely for their own
sakes, but that of their flocks; for if they allow their office
to be degraded, and their characters aspersed, without
maintaining the one and defending the other, their influence will
be seriously weakened, and their usefulness, in the same degree,
diminished.&nbsp; Hence it has ever been the artful policy of the
infidel school to attack religion through her ministers; and such
is the course which is adopted now, and those ministers will aid
and abet the cause of the enemies of their faith, if they repel
not the darts which are meant to reach, through their bodies, the
altars of their God.&nbsp; And would that that portion of the
press, which has long assailed the Clergy with much unmerited
severity and abuse, could be persuaded to make a tardy reparation
for the wrong they have done,&mdash;for the injury they have
inflicted on society!&nbsp; The public journals now reach the
remotest corners of the island; and in many distant parishes, in
which the incumbent alone spends the income drawn from the soil,
alone dispenses his charity, <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>visits the sick, instructs the
ignorant,&mdash;even there the blighting influence of calumny
extends, and the work of Christian benevolence and charity is
neutralized by the splenetic effusions, or foul and false charges
of the public press.&nbsp; Oh! that the awful circumstances of
the present times would teach forbearance, if not
justice,&mdash;would induce silence, if not commendation.&nbsp;
If they love not religion for its own sake,&mdash;if they respect
not its ministers for their own sake,&mdash;let the value of both
be admitted in stemming that fearful tide of sedition and
infidelity which threatens to overturn the civil as well as
religious institutions of the country.&nbsp; And there is another
consideration not to be forgotten: in times of pestilence, the
ministers of God have ever proved faithful to their trust, and a
blessing to the sick and dying: that scourge of the Almighty is
now upon the land; let the press then seek to heal the breach
they have made between the pastor and his flock, lest by the
baleful suspicions and hatred they have caused in the minds of
the latter, they may be the means of intercepting the stream of
Divine mercy,&mdash;of darkening the light of Divine truth.</p>
<p>Vain will be all the efforts of the friends of religion and
order to counteract the present evils, which endanger the best
interests of society, and to introduce a better order of things,
if a large proportion of the public journals continue not only to
excite the public mind, but to prejudice it against <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>the Clergy,
by imputing to them unworthy motives, and by bringing against
them heavy and unsubstantiated charges.&nbsp; In many places at
present, the plans of the Clergyman for the benefit of his parish
are entirely frustrated; a large proportion of his parishioners
being like men labouring under a fever caused by injudicious
treatment,&mdash;the wholesome aliment, which would give
nourishment and strength in a healthy state, injures rather than
benefits; and even the medicines which should cure the disease
are rejected, through distrust of the physician who prescribes
them.&nbsp; But let those who have injured the patient, by
supplying stimulants when they should have administered
sedatives, by exciting suspicion when they should have inspired
confidence, endeavour to repair the evil they have produced, and
then the ministers of the Great Physician of souls will recover
their proper influence, and will be able beneficially to exercise
their important functions.</p>
<p>It is impossible to estimate the advantage of the ministerial
office to society, until the aggregate of the services of men,
who have all their allotted field of action throughout the
kingdom, be well weighed.&nbsp; Let any one examine minutely into
the benefit which one parish receives from a resident incumbent,
who faithfully discharges the duties of his office; and if all do
not so, it is the fault of the individual, and not of the
system:&mdash;let him <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>observe, not merely the general
advantage derived by all from the residence amongst them of a
well informed and well conducted man,&mdash;at once the scholar,
the gentleman, and the Christian,&mdash;but of one who is the
authorized medium through which abuses are to be checked and
corrected, vice discountenanced and reproved, virtue encouraged
and rewarded, relief administered to distress, instruction to
ignorance, comfort to sorrow, and the light of the Gospel
diffused amongst all,&mdash;its offers addressed to all, its
consolation imparted to all.&nbsp; Then let him attempt to
calculate the amount of instruction conveyed through &ldquo;the
alacrity, the zeal, the warm-heartedness which the Established
Clergy have manifested for the education of the poor;&rdquo; <a
name="citation149"></a><a href="#footnote149"
class="citation">[149]</a> of comfort derived by suffering in its
hour of need and sorrow, from its faithful pastor; and of benefit
imparted to all, either directly or indirectly, either temporally
or spiritually, by the appointed and responsible teachers of the
Gospel, throughout the parishes in the kingdom.&nbsp; And then
let him form a judgment as to what degree of confidence is to be
placed in the wisdom, what sense of obligation is to be
entertained for the services,&mdash;<i>not of those</i> who are
labouring with <i>earnest</i> diligence to &ldquo;feed the flock
over which the Holy Ghost has <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>made them
overseers,&rdquo;&mdash;<i>of those</i> who by impoverishing the
Clergy would deprive them of the means of affording temporal
assistance to the poor and needy; and by calumniating the Clergy
would impede the discharge and frustrate the efficacy of their
spiritual ministrations.&nbsp; Alas! it is because the full value
of the quiet and unobtrusive labours of all ranks in the Church
is so little known by those who are actively engaged in public
life, that plans are devised, which, possessing some
plausibility, and coming recommended with much eloquence, are
eagerly embraced by many, who would indignantly reject them were
they aware that, if adopted, they would injure the present and
endanger the eternal welfare of millions.&nbsp; As men, as
statesmen, and as Christians, let all who have inconsiderately
joined in the cry against the Church forbear, until they have
ascertained for themselves, by minute and impartial
investigation, whether it is as wealthy and proud, as grasping
and worldly, as bigoted and intolerant, as intermeddling and
domineering, as inefficient and corrupt, as its enemies have
represented it to be.&nbsp; Could it be proved to be such, every
sincere Christian, whether cleric or laic, would at once say,
free it from the abuses which disgrace its character and impair
its efficiency.&nbsp; But of the charges brought against it, the
large proportion originate in the hostility, hatred, and
malignity of its enemies; there may be some defects, but <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>they are
incidental, not inherent, and are at present occupying the deep
and anxious attention of the heads of the establishment, who are
most desirous to correct whatever may limit the influence or
lessen the usefulness of that pure and reformed branch of the
Church of Christ established in this kingdom.</p>
<p>If the enemies of the Church, who profess to be the friends of
mankind, are sincere, as we are bound to consider them, in the
expression of their wish to benefit their fellow-men, they must
not impede the operation of an establishment which every where
diffuses a knowledge of that Gospel, the salutary influence of
which extends through society, as the only cure of the ills to
which flesh is heir.&nbsp; They may closely watch and severely
scrutinize the proceedings of the Church; but, as men and
Christians, they are bound to do it justice, and give it their
support as a powerful agent, in lightening the load of misery
which too often exists in this commercial country to a frightful
extent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Compare,&rdquo; says the present Bishop of
Chester, &ldquo;compare the ignorant and unreflecting peasant,
who moves in the same dull, and too often sinful track, with no
ideas beyond the ground he treads upon, the sensual indulgences
which he gratifies, and the day that is passing over his
head;&mdash;compare him with his enlightened neighbour, nay, with
himself, if happily he becomes enlightened, when he follows <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>the same
path of active industry, but makes it a path towards his heavenly
Father&rsquo;s kingdom;&mdash;and then perceive, by a visible
example, what the grace of God effects through the agency of man;
or take a case, too common, alas! too familiarly known to many
who hear me.&nbsp; Take the case of those who see their
occupation sinking from under them; their means of support
annually decreasing, and little prospect of its
melioration.&nbsp; Suppose that the views of these, and such as
these, are bounded by this present world, what can they be but
unhappy, restless, discontented; defying God, and murmuring at
man; distressing the philanthropist, because he sees no comfort
left to them; distressing the statesman, because he can devise no
remedy for their relief; above all, distressing the Christian,
who sees the future prospect far darker than the present
gloom?&nbsp; Suppose the case of one thus circumstanced, having
no hope beyond this world; and then contemplate the change which
would be produced, if any of the means by which grace is
communicated to the heart should inspire the same person with the
principles and the faith of the Gospel; converting him from
whatever is evil in his ways, and thus removing all the
accumulation which sin adds to poverty: reconciling him to
hardships and privations as the intended trial of his faith, the
lot of many of God&rsquo;s most approved servants; and lighting
up the darkness of <a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>this world by the rays which precede that which is to
come, the earnest of a brighter dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May those who have been so far misled as to become either
hostile or indifferent to their Church now do tardy justice to
her, which, through good report and evil report, is still true to
her righteous and holy cause, and dispenses through the land the
light and blessing of the Gospel of peace: may those who love,
cherish, and venerate the religion of their fathers&mdash;the
Church of their God&mdash;approve themselves zealous and faithful
sons; our Zion requires active, stanch, vigilant, and experienced
defenders: her enemies are numerous, persevering, powerful,
malignant, implacable; their attacks are sometimes open,
sometimes insidious, but always skilfully planned, and ably
conducted; still, whilst the Church continues true to God and His
Christ, she has nothing to fear, for &ldquo;greater is He who is
for her than he who is against her.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord
is her shield and buckler,&rdquo; and Christ has promised to be
always, even unto the end of the world, with his Church, which is
founded on the rock of faith, and against which &ldquo;the gates
of hell shall not prevail:&rdquo; in humble, but firm reliance,
therefore, upon Him, of whose mystical body she forms a portion,
the Church of England, amid the strifes of political changes,
amid the distractions of civil contentions, amid the storms <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>of popular
clamour and fury, remains stedfast through faith, and joyful
through hope:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As some tall cliff that lifts its awful
form,<br />
Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,<br />
Tho&rsquo; round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,<br />
Eternal sunshine settles on its head.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst, however, we rely with firm and holy confidence upon
the Great Author and Finisher of our Faith, for the protection
and preservation of His Church; zeal, energy, and discretion, in
defence of religion, are not the less requisite in believers, who
labour under their Heavenly Master for the furtherance of His
Gospel.&nbsp; As the Almighty is pleased to employ human agents
for the accomplishment of His gracious designs towards His
creatures; His faithful servants hoping to prove instruments, in
His hands, of good to their fellow men, must use every means in
their power to frustrate the evil designs of the enemies of the
Lord; and to induce a sinful nation, suffering under a Divine
visitation, to put away from them &ldquo;the evil of their
ways,&rdquo; which has called down the Divine displeasure; and
humbling themselves before God to implore His mercy, &ldquo;that
the plague may be stayed from the people.&rdquo; <a
name="citation154"></a><a href="#footnote154"
class="citation">[154]</a>&nbsp; Let, then, all the servants of
the Lord, <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>at this alarming and awful crisis, &ldquo;be very
jealous for the Lord God of Hosts;&rdquo; <a
name="citation155"></a><a href="#footnote155"
class="citation">[155]</a> and pray and labour incessantly for
the defeat of the devices of unbelief; which, whether under the
form of an irreligious spirit seeking to do without Christianity,
or under the bolder aspect of open infidelity, striving to
subvert Christianity, is the main cause of the evils which now
endanger the safety of the civil and religious institutions of
the kingdom.&nbsp; We have seen that, in the case of the lower
classes of society, the tide of profaneness has been setting in
with a force and fury which threaten to overturn all the defences
of religion, morals, and laws, which have long withstood their
fierce assaults&mdash;their destructive ravages.&nbsp; Can it be
that the emissaries of Satan shall be found more zealous and
indefatigable in disseminating the poison which is to destroy
both body and soul, than the servants of God are vigilant,
active, and unwearied, to prevent the bane or supply the
antidote?&nbsp; Can it be that the slaves of sin and darkness,
under the galling yoke of him who is a hard master, will manifest
a more willing and prompt obedience, than the servants of God, in
the cause of their blessed Lord, whose &ldquo;burden is
light,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;whose service is perfect
freedom?&rdquo;&nbsp; We have seen, also, that in the middle and
higher <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>classes of society there appears to be an equally
effective, though less conspicuous, agent at work&mdash;a deep
and silent current, which is gradually, though secretly,
undermining that great foundation of Christianity, that the law
of God is to be the rule of life.&nbsp; This great engine of
evil, as more insidious, is, in reality, more dangerous than the
noisy turbulence of infidel assemblies, or the open circulation
of blasphemous publications; the power of the spirit of darkness,
when, &ldquo;as a roaring lion he walketh about seeking whom he
may devour,&rdquo; is less to be dreaded, than when he employs
the noiseless gliding of &ldquo;the serpent,&rdquo; which
discovers itself only by the sting of death.&nbsp; Can it be that
any of the friends of religion will shut their ears against these
representations of great and alarming danger&mdash;delude
themselves with the groundless anticipations of unjustifiable
hope&mdash;deceive themselves with the distant plans of culpable
procrastination&mdash;or shroud themselves beneath the covering
of indolent supineness and heartless indifference?&nbsp; Too long
palliatives have been employed instead of remedies, expediency
has been substituted for principle, and worldly wisdom has
encroached upon the province of Divine Revelation.&nbsp; As a
Christian nation our laws and institutions should be all
essentially Christian; the foreign and domestic policy of the
State, and the public and private conduct <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>of
individuals, should be all animated by a Christian spirit, and
guided by Christian rules and precedents.</p>
<p>Let us, therefore, enquire by what means is the predominance
of Christianity to be restored, when it is threatened with still
further depression; when it has great and powerful enemies all
plotting its destruction in this country?</p>
<p>There is one mean&mdash;to which reference has been already
made, as being the great object the believer should have in
view&mdash;which would, with the blessing of God, upon whom alone
dependence must rest for success against His enemies, be
effectual in accomplishing this great end, and that is the
zealous and unanimous co-operation of all Christians for the
general diffusion of true religion, sound learning, and useful
knowledge.&nbsp; A very brief examination into the cause which
has contributed largely to the present state of things, so
unfavourable to the interests of genuine Christianity, may
suffice to place this in a clear point of view.</p>
<p>Religious error generally receives its distinguishing features
from the literary character of the age: and an age which abounds
with sciolists is very fertile in sceptics.&nbsp; For it has been
always found that the effect of superficial knowledge is rather
to unsettle, of profound knowledge to confirm, belief in
Revelation; as was well observed by that mighty master in
philosophy, Bacon, who says, &ldquo;a little <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>philosophy
inclines us to atheism, and a great deal of philosophy carries us
back to religion.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the reason of this is obvious;
there are certain difficulties of every subject which lie upon,
or nearly at, the surface; slight labour and research, therefore,
put the enquirer in possession of little more than those
difficulties; whilst if the spirit of patient and accurate
investigation had carried him further, he would have found them
gradually disappear before the light of truth breaking by degrees
upon his mind, and leading him to just and certain conclusions,
drawn from a long series of proofs.&nbsp; Now the present age
appears to be characterized by a wide diffusion of elementary
knowledge amongst all classes of society; by a preference of an
extensive, though necessarily superficial, acquaintance with
general literature and the elements of modern science, to an
accurate and profound knowledge of a few leading branches of
study; and by a tendency to elevate the pursuit of physical above
that of moral and religious truth.&nbsp; From the proposition
laid down, of the ordinary effects of superficial knowledge upon
the mind in the investigation of religious truth, we should
conclude, that such a system of popular instruction is calculated
to indispose towards the full reception of a Divine Revelation;
that the mind, either bewildered by a variety of pursuits, or
dissatisfied by diversity of opinions, will consider all
knowledge uncertain, and <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>all theories unsatisfactory; or
influenced by that intellectual pride and presumption which are
amongst the most bitter fruits of defective knowledge, deem
itself competent to decide summarily upon whatever passes under
its observation.&nbsp; For if it has been found&mdash;as it has
been too often found&mdash;that minds, otherwise highly gifted,
but destitute of religious principles, when long accustomed to
demonstration, are apt to underrate the value of moral proof; and
when long familiar with natural causes, sometimes forget the
great Architect, who formed and put in motion our globe;
sometimes forget the great First Cause, which gave nature her
powers and properties, and now preserves and directs them to a
beneficial end: what must we expect when far inferior minds,
without mental discipline and profound knowledge, those happy
results of laborious and patient study; but with vanity flattered
by appeals made to its judgment, and with pride fostered by the
acquisition of a poor modicum of science, deem themselves
competent not merely to decide upon the most difficult questions
of government and legislation, but upon the most profound truths
of natural and revealed religion?&nbsp; The result may be easily
anticipated; if this empty vanity, this presumptuous pride of
intellect, reject not Christianity at once, it ordinarily takes
an heretical direction, and assuming the specious guise of love
of investigation, <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>and value for the powers of reason, it makes the deep
and awful mysteries of our holy faith the subject of crude
theories and daring speculations; and with powers confessedly
unequal to the explanation of some of the lowest wonders of the
material world, seeks to penetrate within the veil drawn around
the Godhead, and reduce to the level of human comprehension the
very nature of the Divine essence.&nbsp; Should it, however, take
one step further, and that an easy step, it rejects the truths it
had long distorted, it resigns the shadow of which it had never
known the substance, and declaring Christianity to be &ldquo;a
cunningly devised fable,&rdquo; it becomes the advocate of
heartless, hopeless infidelity.</p>
<p>This is no imaginary picture, but one, of the reality and
fidelity of which the present state of society affords too
abundant proof.&nbsp; Not that superficial acquaintance with
science is a thing of new occurrence; not that pride of
intellect&mdash;ever a luxuriant weed in rich but ill-cultivated
soils,&mdash;is a growth peculiar to our times; not that heresy
and infidelity, its bitterest fruits, never till now spread their
poison through our land; but never before was the field so large,
the weeds more rank, and the crop so abundant.&nbsp; Formerly,
science flowed in a few deep and noble rivers, of whose copious
waters the nation at large sparingly drank; we still have many
rich streams which fertilize the <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>land, but in addition to them there
is an infinity of small rivulets, some of which, like mountain
torrents, after a thunder-storm, are brawling and turbulent,
covered with much foam, mixed with much impurity, often rising
over their banks, and spreading havoc and barrenness, where all
was fertility and beauty.&nbsp; Such streams may serve to
illustrate the effects, upon society, of the violence and
turbulence of those, whose imperfect acquaintance with science
has first shaken their own belief, and has then been made
instrumental to the spread of infidel doctrines, amongst those
who had lived in happy ignorance of &ldquo;science, falsely so
called.&rdquo;&nbsp; But would any one, therefore, be so unwise
as to endeavour to keep these turbulent brooks pent up?&nbsp; The
destruction would be only wider and heavier when they at last
burst over the mounds that restrained them: but it is at once the
course of wisdom and of humanity to confine them within their
banks, and give them a due direction, and then, as they descend
towards the plain, gradually the brawling ceases, the froth
disappears, the mud subsides, and you have a pure and quiet
stream diffusing the riches, refreshment, and beauty of science
over the land.&nbsp; No calumny has, perhaps, been more
frequently repeated in the present day than that those who expose
the perversion, are the enemies of science.&nbsp; But in spite of
interested clamour and unjust censure, the Christian is bound <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>to
maintain, that knowledge is valuable in the degree in which it
makes men not merely wiser but better: and that however he may
approve of literary and scientific pursuits, however ready he may
be to extol their value, for great indeed is their value, still
their highest value is in proving subsidiary to the acquisition
of Christian knowledge.&nbsp; Whilst, therefore, he recommends
their attainment, because they are calculated to enlighten and
invigorate the mind, correct and refine the taste, exalt and
dignify the character, to supply a rational and unfailing source
of relaxation and enjoyment, he must ever maintain, that unless
hallowed with some portion of that &ldquo;wisdom which is from
above,&rdquo; they will be useless to their possessor, and may,
by a mischievous perversion, not only be fatal to his present and
future happiness, but injurious to the best interests of a
community.</p>
<p>That the extension of education has contributed to the
production of such evils is true, but it is not less true, that
education is not fairly chargeable with accidental and separable
consequences.&nbsp; The fault has been, that the provision for
the religious instruction of the age, notwithstanding the zeal
and activity shewn to accomplish this great object, has not
increased in the same ratio with that for its advancement in
literature and science.&nbsp; The supply of the mental wants of
the middle and lower classes of society, which have received this
powerful impulsion <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>towards knowledge, has been too much in the hands of
those who avowedly exclude religion from their system of popular
education.&nbsp; Thus, a much neglected soil has been broken up,
and prepared for cultivation, but &ldquo;whilst men slept, the
enemy came and sowed tares in the field;&rdquo; the Lord&rsquo;s
labourers, however, are not therefore to desert the field, but to
employ, for the future, more watchful vigilance, more earnest
zeal, and more assiduous labour.&nbsp; There is no benefit nor
blessing which is not capable of perversion and abuse; but it
would be a strange act of folly to refuse a manifest advantage,
through fear of contingent evil, both the prevention and
correction of which are in our own power.&nbsp; &ldquo;The almost
universal diffusion of elementary knowledge furnishes the enemies
of revealed religion with abundant materials to work upon: but
then it also furnishes the friends of truth with the obvious
means of counteracting the influence of erroneous doctrines, and
of instilling sounder principles into the bulk of the
community.&nbsp; Any attempt to suppress, or even to check, the
spirit of inquiry, which is abroad in the world, would not only
be a vain and fruitless attempt, but a violation of the
indefeasible liberty of the human mind, and an interference with
its natural constitution.&nbsp; To impart to that spirit a right
direction, to sanctify it with holy motives, to temper it to
righteous purposes, to shape it to ends which lie beyond <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>the limits
of this beginning of our existence, will be the endeavour of
those who desire to make the cultivation of intellect conducive
to moral improvement, and to establish the kingdom of Christ at
once in the understanding and affections of mankind.&rdquo; <a
name="citation164"></a><a href="#footnote164"
class="citation">[164]</a></p>
<p>Let, then, all the friends of religion employ some portion of
their time, their influence, and their wealth, in zealously
labouring to promote a general diffusion of true religion, sound
learning, and useful knowledge.&nbsp; Let them be assured that
the mental cultivation of the population of a country, when
properly conducted, will, by elevating the moral character,
always have a beneficial influence upon society; that it can only
be properly conducted when religion forms the basis of the system
of instruction; and that the present ardent thirst for knowledge
will be productive of lasting evil or good to the best interests
of England, accordingly as it is, or is not, directed as to an
object of paramount importance, to that fountain of &ldquo;living
water&rdquo; which floweth for our salvation.</p>
<p>When religion has been made the basis of education, and the
principles of revelation have been clearly understood, and
cordially embraced, a slight acquaintance with science not only
ceases to have any injurious effect upon the mind, but benefits
it, <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>as
the acquisition of useful knowledge must always do: in the
humility, faith, stability, and knowledge of true religion, there
is a safe-guard against the evils usually attendant upon a
superficial acquaintance with natural philosophy in minds
ill-disciplined and ill-informed.&nbsp; Nor is it only that
physical science benefits minds early imbued with religious
principles; a knowledge of many of its departments opens a new
and unfailing source of high and pure enjoyment; it supplies, as
it were, a new sense: before, Creation presented a beautiful and
varied picture, delighting the eye, and filling the heart with
gladness.&nbsp; But it was in a degree like the picture of a
great master, to one unacquainted with painting; the general
beauty, and happiness of effect, were discoverable, but there was
not the full satisfaction which the connoisseur derives from his
knowledge of the art; upon the former, the general effect
principally makes an impression; with the latter, not only the
general effect, but all the variety of details, all the happy
combinations, which have united to produce that effect, are seen,
understood, and appreciated; and there results the high
gratification felt by a cultivated mind, when the eye is pleased,
the understanding exercised, and the judgment satisfied.&nbsp;
However inadequate every illustration, drawn from art, must be to
convey any just conception of the impression which the works of
nature are calculated to make <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>upon the enlightened mind; still
this may afford a faint parallel of the advantage which
scientific men possess over those who have never studied the book
of nature.&nbsp; For physical science improves the perception of
the beauties, whilst it unfolds the wonders, of creation: not
only do the great results of nature&rsquo;s works become, through
it, better understood; but the causes and modes of operation, by
which those results are accomplished, are discovered: and the
student becomes more full of delight and admiration, the further
his researches extend; he traces the nice connexion, which every
where exists between causes and effects; and surveys, with wonder
and praise, the beautiful contrivances, the admirable
adaptations, the perfect harmony, which reign throughout the
creation of God.&nbsp; His mind thus becomes deeply and
powerfully impressed with the uniform perfection visible in the
works of the Deity: if he observe with his telescope a
planet,&mdash;one of those bright bodies which gem the canopy of
heaven,&mdash;or examine with his microscope an insect,&mdash;one
of the minutest beings which sport in the summer&rsquo;s
sunshine,&mdash;he still sees the same perfection; &ldquo;those
rolling fires on high&rdquo; perform their appointed revolutions,
in their several orbits, directed by unvarying laws; and the tiny
insect, equally complete in its organization, exercises, with an
instinct as unerring, its allotted functions.</p>
<p>The whole material universe supplies the student <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>of nature
with a rich field, at once, of investigation and enjoyment: the
mineral, the vegetable, and the animal kingdoms, all disclose
their treasures to his inquiring mind; which is not, however,
limited by the narrow bounds of our terraqueous globe, but ranges
through the fields of ether, far as the eye can penetrate into
the distant regions of illimitable space.&nbsp; Throughout he is
delighted to trace the hand of the Creator; to observe every
where design and arrangement; nothing superfluous, nothing in
vain, but the mighty machinery of a stupendous system; in the
great principles of which there is sublime simplicity, in their
operations unvarying accuracy and matchless contrivance, in their
details endless variety and infinite combinations, and in their
effects utility, beauty, grandeur, and magnificence.&nbsp; The
works of the Almighty far exceed the full comprehension of finite
intelligence, but much further do they transcend adequate
description in uninspired language: man feels all his feebleness
of intellect and of expression, when he attempts to penetrate
deeply into, or to describe accurately, the mighty works of God;
he is then constrained to confess, &ldquo;such knowledge is too
wonderful and excellent for me; I cannot attain unto it.&rdquo;
<a name="citation167"></a><a href="#footnote167"
class="citation">[167]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh Lord, how manifold are
Thy works! in wisdom hast Thou made them all: the earth is full
of Thy <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>riches; so is the great and wide sea also.&rdquo; <a
name="citation168a"></a><a href="#footnote168a"
class="citation">[168a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;The heavens declare the
glory of God, and the firmament sheweth His handy-work.&rdquo; <a
name="citation168b"></a><a href="#footnote168b"
class="citation">[168b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;By the word of the Lord
were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of
His mouth.&nbsp; He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as
it were upon an heap, and layeth up the deep, as in a
treasure-house.&nbsp; Let the earth fear the Lord: stand in awe
of Him, all ye that dwell in the world.&nbsp; For He spake, and
it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.&rdquo; <a
name="citation168c"></a><a href="#footnote168c"
class="citation">[168c]</a>&nbsp; And he breaks forth in the
devout hymn of the Psalmist; &ldquo;Praise the Lord, oh my soul:
oh Lord my God, Thou art become exceeding glorious: Thou art
clothed with majesty and honour.&nbsp; Thou deckest Thyself with
light, as it were with a garment: and spreadest out the heavens
like a curtain.&nbsp; Who layeth the beams of His chambers in the
waters, and maketh the clouds His chariot, and walketh upon the
wings of the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When philosophy is thus sanctified by Christianity, the volume
of nature presents, after the volume of inspiration, the most
instructive and delightful study of man; in both he can read, as
if written by a sun-beam, the power, the wisdom, and the goodness
of the Most High.&nbsp; Would, then, any wish to debar others
from the high intellectual feast which nature bountifully spreads
before all, <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>and of which she pressingly invites all to
partake?&nbsp; Such would be to limit or to divert the streams of
Divine bounty, whilst flowing in their proper channels: such
would be to make a monopoly of one of heaven&rsquo;s best and
freest gifts to man, whilst a pilgrim in this world of
woe,&mdash;the admonitions which nature addressing to the
enlightened and thoughtful mind,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Leads it upward
to a brighter day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would any say, Gaze as long as you like upon the beauties and
wonders of nature, but attempt not to explore its hidden
secrets&mdash;to examine the latent springs of its vast and
complicated machinery?&nbsp; Such would be, as if a man
possessing a curious and exquisite piece of mechanism were to
direct the observers to remark the beauty of the material, the
regularity of the movements, and the certainty of the results,
and yet to forbid them to examine into the principle of
construction and the mode of operation, on which those movements
and that certainty depend.&nbsp; For the proportion, in which he
who has studied the structure of the globe, the wonderful
mechanism of the universe, as far as Revelation and reason have
enabled men to go, derives from its contemplation greater
enjoyment and instruction than he who treads the earth, traverses
the seas, and gazes upon the heavens, ignorant of all philosophy
can teach, is the same <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>as that in which he who understands
mechanics receives greater pleasure and information, than he who
understands them not, from examining the process of a masterly
application of the powers of that science.</p>
<p>Let, therefore, the knowledge of physical science be widely
diffused, but let the basis of Christian principles be first
laid; for thus not only may the evil of scepticism be provided
against, but the field of moral and intellectual enjoyment and
improvement will be enlarged to the student; for never does the
study of the material universe more elevate the mind, and expand
the heart, than when we are accustomed to refer every thing to a
great and gracious Creator,&mdash;to look habitually</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Through nature
up to nature&rsquo;s God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We know that there is a superficial philosophy, which
casts the glare of a most seducing brilliancy around it; and
spurns the Bible, with all the doctrine and all the piety of the
Bible, away from it; and has infused the spirit of Antichrist
into many of the literary establishments of the age: but it is
not the solid, the profound, the cautious spirit of that
philosophy, which has done so much to ennoble the modern period
of our world; for the more that this spirit is cultivated and
understood, the more will it be found in alliance with that
Spirit, in virtue of which all that exalteth itself against the
knowledge <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>of God is humbled, and all lofty imaginations are cast
down, and every thought of the heart is brought into the
captivity of the obedience of Christ.&rdquo; <a
name="citation171"></a><a href="#footnote171"
class="citation">[171]</a></p>
<p>The first great principle, therefore, which all must steadily
keep in view and strenuously advocate, is that <i>the Bible
should form the basis of education</i>.&nbsp; It is not
sufficient to say, that education is to be conducted on religious
principles, for on the subject of religion there exists, in this
day, a most unfortunate and mischievous variety of opinions,
which would be much diminished if the Holy Scriptures were made
the real, as they are the professed, groundwork of every system
of Christian instruction.&nbsp; Two other great principles, which
the true servants of God should strongly recommend and enforce,
as being intimately and necessarily connected with the
first&mdash;that the Bible is to be the basis of
education,&mdash;are, that <i>the Bible is to be the rule of
faith</i>, <i>and the guide of public and private life</i>.&nbsp;
From a neglect of these three great principles of Christian
conduct, it is hardly too much to say, that almost all the evils
which afflict society have arisen: for they all reciprocate, and
mutually contribute to their common perpetuation.&nbsp; The man
of the world educates his son in the way best calculated to
promote his temporal advancement: and that son, in his turn, <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>when he
becomes a father, is regardless of the eternal interests of his
child, which he has never been taught to value.&nbsp; For the
system begun in childhood is continued through all the stages of
life; and &ldquo;the spirit returns unto God who gave it,&rdquo;
having been occupied almost to the last moment of human existence
with the pursuit of worldly advantage and enjoyment.&nbsp; Here
we have, consequently, only the name of Christianity; for neither
do its motives influence, nor its rules guide the conduct: there
may be the external form, but there is not the power of
godliness; there may be the cold and lifeless statue, there is
not the living Christian, possessed of intelligence, volition,
and motion, and animated by faith and hope,&mdash;the origin,
exercise, and direction of which belong to the Spirit of
God.&nbsp; This is a necessary consequence of that neglect of the
Bible, which has been already noticed as being such a prolific
source of error.&nbsp; There is very general in the world a
standard of faith and morals, which Scripture does not recognize,
and a reliance upon Divine mercy, which Scripture does not
sanction.&nbsp; Thus the world calls vices venial, which
Scripture says shall exclude from heaven; and the world speaks
peace, where Scripture pronounces woe.&nbsp; Take, however, the
life of a large body of men, trace it from the cradle to the
grave; observe in childhood its toys, in boyhood its sports, in
youth its pleasures, in manhood its <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>occupations and enjoyments, and in
age its employments; all in succession deemed of supreme
importance, and the excessive indulgence of which has never been
considered criminal: then take the Bible, and compare the survey
you have made with what it reveals of the nature and object of
man&rsquo;s probation; and the conclusion will force itself
irresistibly and painfully upon you, that as life is to be a
state of moral discipline to fit the heir of immortality for his
bright inheritance, the life, which has been depicted, is not
that which will lead to the blessed mansions of heaven.</p>
<p>Against this spurious Christianity, let the friends of true
religion every where raise their voice, for like a currency of
base coin, it is not only without value in itself, but deludes
its possessor with the false idea of possessing wealth.&nbsp; Let
them point out the folly and the danger of receiving religious
opinions from the world, instead of from God&rsquo;s book; for as
the light of the sun is coloured by the stained glass through
which it passes, so the rays of Divine truth, being tinged by the
perverted medium through which they are received, may deceive
those who imagine they are enjoying the bright beams of the Sun
of Righteousness.&nbsp; And let them warn all against walking by
another&rsquo;s light,&mdash;though he may appear &ldquo;a
shining and a burning light&rdquo;&mdash;instead of searching for
themselves the lively oracles of Scripture; it may be, as in the
case of a party in a dark <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>and dangerous cavern, where few only
possess lamps, that the whole may proceed in safety; but surely
the security is not so great as if each possessed his own lamp;
and great would be the folly of him, who warned of the danger,
and assured of the necessity of having a lamp of his own,
rejected the friendly offer of assistance, which would guide him
in safety, and trusted to the uncertain light of another, which,
falling on broken and uneven ground, deceived the eye, and risked
his precipitation into some deep abyss, from which extrication
was impossible.</p>
<p>Let them every where teach and impress, as a duty of paramount
importance, that not only the education of all classes, from the
prince to the peasant, should be conducted on the principles of
the Bible; but that all should acquire that knowledge of the
evidences as well as doctrines and duties of Christianity, which
may fit them in their several stations to overcome, through the
grace of God, the temptations to unbelief or immorality, which
are likely to assail them.&nbsp; It is a painful reflection, how
many youths of bright prospects, great talents, and amiable
dispositions, have made shipwreck of their present and eternal
hopes, from a want of early religious instruction.&nbsp; How many
are less ashamed of being found ignorant of the Bible than any
other book, and whilst they would blush not to be acquainted with
some new, though unimportant, <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>discovery in science, feel no shame
in never having learnt the important discoveries made by
Revelation to man.&nbsp; And how many, in an evil age, want
courage to admit a knowledge of the Bible, with the great truths
of which they have been made imperfectly acquainted, but have
neither learnt their value nor imbibed their spirit.</p>
<p>Let, therefore, the true servants of the Lord labour
diligently to counteract the rationalizing spirit in theology,
the neglect of Divine Providence, the ascription of every thing
to natural causes, the endeavour, in short, to do without
Christianity in the affairs of life, which so extensively
prevail.&nbsp; And let them discountenance and repress, and, when
fitted by previous education and study, refute the objections
which scepticism and infidelity now advance in society, not only
unblushingly avowing their unbelief, but attempting to spread its
poison in private families.&nbsp; It would not be for the
advantage of religion to commit to inexperienced hands the
weapons of controversy, for the great strength of infidelity lies
in perplexing subtilities and ingenious sophisms, which are
calculated to puzzle an ill-read and illogical disputant.&nbsp;
But every Christian should &ldquo;know the certainty of those
things wherein he has been instructed.&rdquo; <a
name="citation175"></a><a href="#footnote175"
class="citation">[175]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;And be ready always to
give an answer to every man that asketh a reason <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>of the hope
that is in him, with meekness and fear.&rdquo; <a
name="citation176"></a><a href="#footnote176"
class="citation">[176]</a>&nbsp; The neglect of instruction in
the evidences, in the general system of religious education, is
at once most unwise, and most calculated fearfully to promote the
spread of unbelief: in the first place, it is like attempting to
build a house without laying a good foundation: the winds and
floods of infidelity assail it, and it falls, because built on
sand: in the second place, the fall of one house generally more
or less injures those adjoining: thus the cause of unbelief is
advanced, not only by the accession of every new convert, but by
the shock which his fall occasions to the faith of his friends
and acquaintance.&nbsp; Let, therefore, the friends of religion
at once secure to the evidences their proper place in every
system of education, and also take care that their own principles
be fortified by that sound &ldquo;knowledge which maketh not
ashamed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let them never suffer the cause of God to
be blasphemed, or the truth of religion denied in society,
without entering, at least, their protest; and let them never
suffer the questions and doubts of scepticism to be propounded in
their families, without at once silencing the dangerous inmate,
who seeks to spread his secret poison, by inviting enquiry and
provoking discussion.&nbsp; It is true many of the objections
urged in society are of a nature which little learning, in <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>addition to
good common sense, may suffice to answer.&nbsp; As, for instance,
the existence of mysteries in Christianity; whilst, in truth, the
absence of mysteries in a Revelation would be a strong argument
against its Divine origin: the terms employed in creeds and
articles, the form of worship and the discipline of the Church;
for all of which Christianity is not strictly liable, as, though
in perfect conformity with, some of them have been engrafted
upon, Revelation: and the sins into which believers, who disgrace
their profession, are betrayed; for which Christianity cannot be
to blame, as it would be most manifest injustice to visit upon a
Revelation, the offences of unworthy members, of which their own
sinfulness is the sole cause.&nbsp; But such is the mode of
warfare of the light troops of the infidel host, who dare not
attack directly the evidences, doctrines, and precepts of the
Gospel; and yet from their numbers, activity, and malignity, have
deeply injured the cause of religion, by insinuating doubts, and
instilling suspicions into ill-informed and inexperienced
minds.</p>
<p>If those who bear the Christian name and believe the Christian
faith would unite against this legion of evil spirits, and employ
their rank, influence, talents, and learning, in bringing them
into subjection to Him, whose easy yoke they have thrown off, for
the service of Satan, the cause of religion would be immensely
benefited.&nbsp; Not only because many unbelievers would probably
be converted, but because <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>the work of proselytism would be
checked: at present, from the culpable supineness and
indifference of many Christians, even in private families,
infidelity is sometimes heard, unblushingly, to avow its
detestable principles; but if the ban of proscription was placed
upon its creed, the ears of believers would not be shocked, and
the principles of the inexperienced endangered by direct or
indirect attacks upon the great truths of our most Holy
Faith.</p>
<p>To effect a general co-operation of the great body of
Christians, in the cause of religion, would be, necessarily, a
work of immense difficulty and labour.&nbsp; Much, however, might
be accomplished, if more of those, whom God has blessed with
power and influence, set an example of labouring zealously to
promote His glory and the advancement of His kingdom.&nbsp; How
often, amongst the higher and middle classes of society, has the
influence of a single individual, of talents and learning, but of
still more eminent piety, been employed with the most beneficial
effects.&nbsp; &ldquo;A word spoken in due season, how good is
it,&rdquo; <a name="citation178"></a><a href="#footnote178"
class="citation">[178]</a> has been fully proved, in the case of
many, who, vibrating, as it were, in such perfect equipoise
between good and evil, that a feather would almost suffice to
incline the balance, have been led to &ldquo;choose that good
part, which shall <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>not be taken away from them;&rdquo; <a
name="citation179a"></a><a href="#footnote179a"
class="citation">[179a]</a> by having books recommended or
supplied, by receiving friendly advice and encouragement, or by
that most eloquent and attractive of the modes of conveying
instruction&mdash;the winning grace and beauty of Christian
example.&nbsp; If, therefore, even a few individuals or families,
in any place, resolved that, by Divine grace, &ldquo;as for me
and my house, we will serve the Lord;&rdquo; <a
name="citation179b"></a><a href="#footnote179b"
class="citation">[179b]</a>&nbsp; I will not be &ldquo;unequally
yoked with unbelievers;&rdquo; <a name="citation179c"></a><a
href="#footnote179c" class="citation">[179c]</a> as far as in me
lieth, no one shall blaspheme the Holy Name by which I am called,
nor malign the holy cause which in baptism I have sworn to
defend; infidelity would be much put to shame and silence.&nbsp;
And it is the duty of all sincere Christians to adopt this
course, for they are bound to use every means in their power, to
discourage infidelity; they must not admit it into the intimacy
and confidence of domestic life; the sacrifice may sometime be
painful, but it must be made; there may not be any compromise of
Christian obligations, which forbid every unholy alliance:
&ldquo;for what fellowship hath righteousness with
unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? and
what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that
believeth, with an infidel?&rdquo; <a name="citation179d"></a><a
href="#footnote179d" class="citation">[179d]</a>&nbsp; Believers
must warn, exhort, entreat, and, if in their power, <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>instruct
the unbeliever; but, if in vain, then the divine command applies,
&ldquo;come out from among them, and be ye separate:&rdquo; if
both parties be sincere, the contrariety of habits, feelings,
sentiments, and even of enjoyments, which exists between them,
must render familiar intercourse little agreeable or profitable
to the servant of God; who, if he be a weak or wavering disciple,
may receive much injury, where he cannot benefit; and, if he be a
firm and established disciple, when he finds his efforts to
convince the gainsayer fruitless, however ready he may still
continue to be to lend assistance, to admonish, and to observe
all the courtesies of life; yet he cannot assign a place in his
heart, or receive as a chosen and favoured associate, one who is
not united with him in the sweet bonds of Christian fellowship:
there exists a bar, for the present, insuperable, why such may
not be addressed in the affectionate language of the Psalmist,
&ldquo;thou, my companion, my guide, and mine own familiar
friend;&rdquo; and that bar is, they cannot &ldquo;take sweet
counsel together, and walk in the house of God as friends.&rdquo;
<a name="citation180"></a><a href="#footnote180"
class="citation">[180]</a></p>
<p>To defeat, however, the devices and to frustrate the labours
of the emissaries of infidelity amongst the labouring population
of the country, religious associations should be formed: for an
evil of such magnitude will never be remedied, until there are
the <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>more
extensive and effective results of well concerted and combined
operations, in the place of the desultory movements of partial or
individual zeal.&nbsp; This it may be said is already done by
societies, amongst which the venerable Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge has stood forward with the most praiseworthy
zeal and activity to stem the tide of infidelity, which has been,
during the last year, spreading poison and death.&nbsp; But
increased efficiency would be given even to the labours of this
valuable Society, by associations of the nature proposed; the
object of which would be, not only the present remedy, but the
prevention of evils so dangerous to the best interests of
society.&nbsp; And how great might be the blessed effects, in
checking the secret and open enemies of the Gospel, if its true
friends stood forward, and united heart and hand with their
appointed pastors&mdash;giving them all the aid of their rank and
influence, and acting, under their superintendence and direction,
in the discharge of duties, which may with propriety be delegated
to laymen!</p>
<p>A writer, who has been already quoted at considerable length,
to shew the deep devices, the bold effrontery, the unwearied
zeal, and the alarming success of infidel teachers in the
metropolis, asks the important question, &ldquo;what is to be
done in a state of things like this?&nbsp; Shall we look calmly
on, and say, let them alone; the authors and propagators <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>of the
mischief are profligate and worthless men, whom nobody will
trust; and, therefore, too contemptible to be noticed.&nbsp;
Alas! we should only deceive ourselves, and be led to neglect
others, by taking this flattering unction to our souls.&mdash;It
is clear, therefore, that some active and present remedy must be
brought to meet the evil; and there is none which presents itself
so readily and so naturally, as that which may be derived from
the arguments, and the testimony, and the advice of the true
friends of Christianity, particularly of the
ministers.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the whole labour must not devolve
upon the clergy: not from any wish to spare them, whose duty it
is ever to be found in the van, in every attack upon the enemies
of the Lord,&mdash;and ever to bear the brunt of the battle; but
because the active co-operation of the laity is essential to the
success of the undertaking.&nbsp; It has been the artful policy
of the infidel teachers to endeavour to persuade their ignorant
auditors that our holy religion is a system of priestcraft; in
the preservation of which its ministers will always, necessarily,
be actively engaged, because they are deeply interested.&nbsp;
The deluded followers, therefore, of this satanic school, may
look with more than a suspicious eye upon the anxious labours of
their pastor to undeceive them; they may read in it a direct
confirmation of what they have heard, and ascribe solely to
self-interest what emanates <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>from the pious zeal and sense of
duty of him who &ldquo;watches over them as one that is to give
account.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when they see associated with the
minister, in the work of Christian charity and instruction,
laymen, whom they know to have no inducement to support a system
of fraud, and whom they may believe to be too honest and
honourable to promote the cause of error, they are more likely to
banish the suspicion of unworthy motives, which, in the present
distempered state of their minds, opposes an insuperable bar to
the reception of religious truth.</p>
<p>We have had in all our towns, and even in many large villages,
boards of health formed to visit and enquire into the state of
the poor; let similar religious boards be established under the
direction of the parochial clergy, to promote their spiritual
health.&nbsp; Numerous and great are the evils which have arisen
from the population of many parishes having increased beyond the
means of accommodation in the parish churches and almost beyond
the personal visitation and superintendence of the parochial
clergy.&nbsp; It has given rise to much almost compulsory
secession from the Church, has weakened the influence of the
Clergy, and has been productive of the still greater evils of
immorality, irreligion, and impiety.&nbsp; Plans, therefore, have
been drawn up and acted upon with the most happy effect in some
places, for the formation of visiting societies.&nbsp; These <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>have
already received the sanction of two prelates, who preside over
populous dioceses, the Bishops of London and Chester, who have
both recommended them in their Charges to their Clergy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The vastness of the field,&rdquo; observes the Bishop of
London, &ldquo;which demands their exertions, and their own
insufficiency to meet that demand according to the promptings of
their conscience, and the impulse of a truly Christian charity,
are matters which lie heavily upon the mind of many faithful
zealous clergymen.&nbsp; In the discharge of those duties which,
in a populous parish, far exceed the physical abilities of the
strongest and most devoted minister, great assistance may be
derived from parochial visiting associations, acting in
subordination to the Clergy.&nbsp; By kind, yet not intrusive
enquiry into the wants, both temporal and spiritual, of the poor;
by well-timed aid, by encouragement, and counsel; by exhortations
to the duty of reading the Scriptures, of public worship, of
sanctifying the Lord&rsquo;s Day, of regulating the behaviour of
their children; by directing them, in cases of sickness, or of
ignorance, or of troubled conscience, to their appointed pastor,
such an association may work incalculable good, and become
powerfully, though indirectly, instrumental in preaching the
Gospel to the poor.&nbsp; But it is incumbent on me to caution
the parochial Clergy against relinquishing the superintendence
and direction of these auxiliary labourers; and <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>against
delegating to them their own peculiar functions and duties, as
the commissioned interpreters of Scripture, as the Lord&rsquo;s
remembrancers for his people, and as the appointed guides of
their devotion.&nbsp; There is a special promise of blessing
annexed to ministerial service; and the sense of that specialty
ought not to be effaced from the minds of our flocks, by the
permitted intrusion of laymen, however pious and zealous, into
that which belongs to our own peculiar office.&nbsp; If this be
not attended to, you must expect that tares will spring up in the
wheat, and that your visiting societies will become so many
nurseries of schism.&rdquo; <a name="citation185"></a><a
href="#footnote185" class="citation">[185]</a></p>
<p>The Bishop of Chester, after giving a striking description of
the transforming power of Divine grace, thus
continues&mdash;&ldquo;And can these things be?&nbsp; &lsquo;O
Lord God thou knowest.&rsquo;&nbsp; Earnestness,
disinterestedness, simplicity, godly sincerity, patience in
teaching, watchfulness in seizing the favourable moment for
counsel, are known to overcome even that which seems most
hopeless; the effects of natural corruption, inflamed by evil
example, and strengthened by habits of wilful disobedience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be asked, however, &lsquo;Who is
sufficient,&rsquo; physically &lsquo;sufficient for these
things?&nbsp; Certainly in our larger parishes it is not possible
for the strength or activity of the Clergy alone to provide <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>for such
individual instruction.&nbsp; But, there is a resource at hand:
when the population is moderate, nothing is wanting but
resolution and contrivance; and in the case of a denser
population, the bane and the antidote, the evil and the remedy
are found together.&nbsp; The same population, which presses so
heavily, affords also that variety of ranks and degree of
superior education, that many fellow-workers may assist the
minister, and diminish his labours.&nbsp; In this manner the
Apostles were enabled to execute the manifold concerns which lay
upon them.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They have left us an
example.&nbsp; Let the minister of a populous district, using
careful discrimination of character, select such as &lsquo;are
worthy,&rsquo; and of &lsquo;good report,&rsquo; and assign them
their several employments under his direction: they may lessen
his own labour by visiting and examining the schools, by reading
and praying with the infirm and aged, by consoling the fatherless
and widows in their affliction, and pursuing the many nameless
ways by which it is in the power of one Christian to benefit and
relieve another.&nbsp; Such charity, even more than any other
charity, is useful to the giver as well as to the receiver: it
occupies minds, which, for want of engagement, might otherwise
prey upon themselves: and it occupies them in a way which better
fits them for eternity: in religion, as in worldly matters, we
often learn our best lessons by teaching.&nbsp; What image more
exemplifying the reality of pastoral <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>care, what more truly Christian
picture can be presented to our contemplation, than that of a
minister uniting with himself the best disposed and the most
competent portion of his parishioners, and superintending
counsels, and directing plans which have God for their object,
and the eternal welfare of his people for their end; seizing
every opportunity of general and individual good, correcting
mischiefs at their first rising, providing for the spiritual
wants of every different age and class, and thus striving, as far
as may be allowed, to &lsquo;present every man perfect in Christ
Jesus?&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Nor is this any visionary
notion; pleasing in idea, but impracticable in reality.&nbsp;
Numerous parishes, of different degrees of population, have been
brought under such discipline with more or less success.&nbsp;
And I feel convinced that whoever is anxious to promote the glory
of God, to assist the most important interests of his
fellow-creatures, to confirm the security of his country, or
maintain the stability of his Church, can ensure none of those
great objects more effectively than by means like these.&nbsp;
Without them, in some of our crowded districts of dense and
extended population, the Church is lost sight of, parochial
distinctions are obliterated, and the reciprocal charities and
duties of the pastor and the flock are forgotten by the people,
because it is physically impossible that they should be
satisfactorily discharged.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>The
awful visitation which has fallen upon the country renders such
societies at this time of increased value and importance.&nbsp;
They are calculated powerfully to assist the labours of the
Clergy in endeavouring to improve, to the religious advantage of
their flocks, the apprehension which is so general.&nbsp; Seasons
of alarm and affliction are often peculiarly favourable for the
reception of Christian instruction: &ldquo;the fear of the Lord
is the beginning of wisdom;&rdquo; and when men look around them
and see or hear of death under its most terrible forms, and
discover the insufficiency of human means to prevent or remedy
the evil they dread, they may &ldquo;fear Him which is able to
destroy both soul and body in hell;&rdquo; <a
name="citation188a"></a><a href="#footnote188a"
class="citation">[188a]</a> and thus be led to flee to Him who is
able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by
Him. <a name="citation188b"></a><a href="#footnote188b"
class="citation">[188b]</a>&nbsp; Immense might be the benefit,
which would, through the blessing of God on their labours, accrue
to the cause of religion, if parochial visiting associations were
established generally throughout the kingdom, under the direction
of the Clergy.&nbsp; They might form channels through which the
valuable tracts against vice and infidelity, which the Society
for Promoting Christian Knowledge is now circulating, might be
more widely distributed; through which short addresses, and
strong appeals to the conscience, and earnest calls to
repentance, in <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>direct reference to the pestilence, might be brought
home to every family.&nbsp; They might constitute a medium
through which the parochial Clergy might communicate with every
part of the most populous and extensive parishes regularly and
frequently; through which they might diffuse much bounty,
kindness, instruction, and exhortation to their poor and ignorant
parishioners.&nbsp; It is impossible not to see at once that such
associations might be so framed as to be productive of the most
extensive and beneficial results to the Church and people of
England; they are calculated to restore the influence of the
Clergy, and extend their sphere of usefulness amongst their
flocks.&nbsp; Notwithstanding all the arts of the enemies of our
Establishment, the people of England always have loved, and still
love their Church: wherever a contrary feeling subsists, it may
be always traced to a local or temporary cause; but still it must
be admitted, that the immense population of some parishes, under
existing circumstances, is likely to produce estrangement from
the appointed pastor; an evil, which the visiting societies are
admirably adapted to remedy.&nbsp; Some may object to such
associations as being likely to encroach upon the separate and
peculiar duties of the ministerial character: such would be an
evil of the most serious nature, for no one must presume to
intrude himself uncalled upon the priest&rsquo;s office: but,
though it is true every good is capable <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>of abuse,
this is an abuse which may be always especially guarded against
by the clergyman who selects and controls the visitors, receives
their reports, and superintends their operations: whilst as a
further security against the perversion of such associations to
party or sectarian views, it might be made a standing rule, that
no tract should be circulated in any parish, which had not
received the sanction of the incumbent or his curate.&nbsp; To
arrange the machinery and frame the laws of a general system of
parochial visiting societies, must be a work of time; but
experience has already proved that they may be so framed and
conducted as to be productive of great and unmixed
advantage.&nbsp; And never could such aid come more opportunely
than at the present time: we have already seen the number,
fierceness, and malignity of the enemies, who beleaguer our Zion,
&ldquo;and cry, down with her, down with her, even to the
ground.&rdquo;&nbsp; The assistance of the laity, who are
faithfully attached and devoted to the cause of true religion,
will, therefore, be invaluable, at such a time, in defeating the
designs of those who seek to alienate the minds of the flock from
their regular pastors, to corrupt their principles, and make them
ready instruments for the execution of their deep and wicked
schemes: nor will the co-operation of pious laymen, with the
clergy, in using every means to bring the great bulk of the
people to humble them <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>selves before God, in the day of
their visitation, be a less important service.&nbsp; The
Christian minister resembles a beacon on a dangerous coast, which
warns against sand-banks, sunken rocks, and precipitous shores:
in fair weather, its single bright and steady light, which,
shining through the darkness, guides in safety the passing
vessels, is alone sufficient; but when the tempest rages, when
fogs obscure its brightness, when some vessels, having struck on
sunken rocks, are foundering; when others have grounded on
sand-banks, and others are stranded amid&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;The impervious
horrors of a lee-ward shore;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>then other, and most prompt assistance, is required; signal
guns are to be fired, the life-boat launched, and the various
life-preserving apparatus prepared.&nbsp; God has seen fit to
cast our lot on troublesome times; the storms of passion howl
around our Church, and her light cannot penetrate the mists of
prejudice: the barks of thousands, therefore, committed to the
stormy ocean of life,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Youth at the
helm, and Pleasure at the prow,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>are in danger of striking on the sunken rocks of secret
doubts, or of being wrecked on the exposed and rugged shore of
dark despairing infidelity: gladly, therefore, will
&ldquo;God&rsquo;s watchman,&rdquo; who looks <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>with alarm
and distress from his watch-tower, on this scene of imminent
danger, avail himself of the friendly hand which offers to aid
him in affording rescue from the impending destruction.&nbsp; Oh!
to the ministers of the Gospel,&mdash;who feel how much the value
and responsibility of their sacred office is increased in times
like the present; who are almost overwhelmed by a sense of what
is required of them as &ldquo;overseers over God&rsquo;s
heritage,&rdquo; as &ldquo;watchmen in Israel,&rdquo; as
&ldquo;ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of
God,&rdquo;&mdash;assistance from pious, zealous, and discreet
laymen, acting under their direction, must be peculiarly valuable
and acceptable.&nbsp; Oh! only those who &ldquo;have always in
remembrance into how high a dignity and to how weighty an office
and charge they have been called, to teach and to premonish, to
feed and to provide for the Lord&rsquo;s family; to seek for
Christ&rsquo;s sheep that are dispersed abroad, and for his
children who are in the midst of this naughty world that they may
be saved through Christ for ever,&rdquo; <a
name="citation192"></a><a href="#footnote192"
class="citation">[192]</a> can fully estimate the value of any
aid, however feeble, which comes to them at a time, when maligned
and vilified, they find the difficulty of a due discharge of
their sacred duties immensely increased by the impediments thrown
in their way by the enemies of the Gospel.</p>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>Perhaps there never was a time which more than the
present required zeal blended with discretion, firmness tempered
with meekness, and faithfulness softened by charity, in the
Christian minister: well does the admonition of our blessed Lord
to his disciples apply to those whom, in this day, he has called
to be pastors under Himself&mdash;&ldquo;be ye wise as serpents
and harmless as doves.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are two other passages
of Scripture which appear to present a striking view of an
important duty of the clerical office in times like the present,
and of the mode in which it is to be exercised: the command
addressed to Isaiah, &ldquo;Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy
voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgressions,
and the house of Jacob their sins.&rdquo; <a
name="citation193a"></a><a href="#footnote193a"
class="citation">[193a]</a>&nbsp; And the instructions given by
St. Paul to Timothy, &ldquo;The servant of the Lord must not
strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in
meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God,
peradventure, will give them repentance to the acknowledgment of
the truth.&rdquo; <a name="citation193b"></a><a
href="#footnote193b" class="citation">[193b]</a>&nbsp; It is the
duty of Christian ministers to exhort and console each other in
the difficult work they have to perform; &ldquo;to put one
another always in remembrance;&rdquo; to &ldquo;bear one
another&rsquo;s burdens;&rdquo; to &ldquo;admonish one another in
the spirit of meekness and brotherly love.&rdquo;&nbsp; How high
is the dignity of the ministerial office!&nbsp; &ldquo;Let <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>a man so
account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the
mysteries of God.&rdquo; <a name="citation194a"></a><a
href="#footnote194a" class="citation">[194a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Now
then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you
by us, we pray you in Christ&rsquo;s stead, be ye reconciled unto
God.&rdquo; <a name="citation194b"></a><a href="#footnote194b"
class="citation">[194b]</a>&nbsp; How awful its
responsibility!&nbsp; &ldquo;Son of man, I have made thee a
watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore, hear the word of my
mouth, and give them warning from me: when I say unto the wicked,
thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor
speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life;
the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will
I require at thine hand.&rdquo; <a name="citation194c"></a><a
href="#footnote194c" class="citation">[194c]</a>&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take heed, therefore, unto yourselves, and to all the
flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed
the Church of God, which He hath purchased with his own
blood.&rdquo; <a name="citation194d"></a><a href="#footnote194d"
class="citation">[194d]</a>&nbsp; How great the satisfaction, how
sweet the joys of a successful ministry!&nbsp; &ldquo;For what is
our hope or joy, or crown of rejoicing?&nbsp; Are not even ye in
the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, at his coming?&nbsp; For
ye are our glory and joy.&rdquo; <a name="citation194e"></a><a

&ldquo;Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our
affliction and distress by your faith: for now we live, if ye
stand fast in the Lord: for what thanks can we render to God
again for you, for all the joy, <a name="page195"></a><span

&ldquo;Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the
error of his ways shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a
multitude of sins.&rdquo; <a name="citation195d"></a><a

and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars for ever
and ever.&rdquo; <a name="citation195e"></a><a
href="#footnote195e" class="citation">[195e]</a>&nbsp; Many
distinguished bishops and pastors, who have shone as bright
lights in our church, have strongly recommended that every
clergyman should have his appointed seasons in which he
&ldquo;communes with his own heart, and in his chamber, and is
still;&rdquo; meditates deeply upon his important, responsible,
and sacred office; reads, studies, and prays over the ordination
service; and diligently, strictly, and impartially examines into
how far he has been, through Divine grace, enabled to keep his
ordination vows&mdash;to perform his ordination
obligations.&nbsp; Such a practice is of such manifest propriety
and use, that doubtless it prevails extensively: and high indeed,
is the standard <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>of duty, and strict the requirements of service, which
our Church imposes upon every minister: &ldquo;See that you never
cease your labour, your care, and diligence, until ye have done
all that lieth in you to bring all such as are committed to your
charge unto that agreement in the faith and knowledge of God, and
to that ripeness and perfectness of age in Christ, that there be
no place left for error in religion, or for viciousness of
life.&rdquo; <a name="citation196a"></a><a href="#footnote196a"
class="citation">[196a]</a></p>
<p>The prophet Isaiah thus prays to the Lord: &ldquo;Yea, in the
way of Thy judgments, O Lord, have we waited for Thee; the desire
of our soul is to Thy name, and to the remembrance of Thee.&nbsp;
With my soul have I desired Thee in the night; yea, with my
spirit within me, will I seek Thee early; <span class="smcap">for
when Thy judgments are in the earth</span>, <span
class="smcap">the inhabitants of the world will learn
righteousness</span>.&rdquo; <a name="citation196b"></a><a
href="#footnote196b" class="citation">[196b]</a>&nbsp; How
&ldquo;instant in season, and out of season,&rdquo; must all the
ministers of the Gospel be, that through the blessing of God,
they may make the Divine visitation, which has fallen on the
land, conducive to the religious improvement of their several
flocks.&nbsp; The very fear of the consequences of intemperance,
as being considered to predispose the system towards this
dreadful disease, has, in many places, operated to the production
of a great external reformation of the habits of life; let then
<a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>the
favourable moment be seized, and every means used, that the inner
man may be converted to God.&nbsp; It is not sufficient, that the
pestilence should be considered as a judgment, and thus made the
occasion of private and public exhortation; the press should teem
with tracts on this most important and engrossing subject; and
there should be diffused throughout the country, under every
form, and adapted to every rank in life, admonition and entreaty
for all to improve to their soul&rsquo;s health the spread of a
pestilence, which so often destroys the body which it
attacks.&nbsp; Every clergyman has his own sphere of influence
within which, at least, his labours may be beneficially
exercised; and if, by publishing, he benefits only those who are
principally dependent on him for religious instruction, he should
consider himself well repaid:&mdash;but who know how far they may
be instruments in God&rsquo;s hands for good to their fellow
men?&nbsp; The Almighty often selects feeble agents to accomplish
great results, that it may be seen, that &ldquo;neither is he
that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth: but God that
giveth the increase.&rdquo; <a name="citation197"></a><a
href="#footnote197" class="citation">[197]</a>&nbsp; And oh! what
a source of joy there is to the true believer in hoping he may be
an humble instrument in God&rsquo;s hands of &ldquo;winning souls
to Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; The excellent Doddridge, in the preface
to his &ldquo;Rise and Progress of <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>Religion in the Soul,&rdquo; says,
he should consider his labour far more than amply compensated, if
his work, through the Divine blessing, be made instrumental to
the conversion <i>of one sinner</i>.&nbsp; What a field is now
opened to the ministers of the Gospel, in which they may hope,
through God&rsquo;s grace and blessing, &ldquo;<i>to turn many to
righteousness</i>;&rdquo; for in times of great national
apprehension and danger the cause of true religion often advances
and flourishes.&nbsp; And oh! how sweet in such seasons, how
doubly blessed&mdash;blessed both to those who minister, and to
those who are ministered unto&mdash;is the faithful and zealous
discharge of the duties of their high and holy calling, who are
commissioned to pour the balm of consolation on the wounded
spirit, to bind up the broken-hearted, to sooth the terrors of
affrighted conscience, and to lead the humble, and contrite, and
heavy-laden, to the Saviour, that they may take His yoke upon
them, and find rest unto their souls.</p>
<p>Archbishop Leighton, the bright ornament of Scottish
Episcopacy, has forcibly stated the nature and obligations of the
Christian ministry, in commenting upon that most instructive
passage in the First general Epistle of St. Peter, &ldquo;Feed
the flock of God, which is among you, taking the oversight
thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre,
but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God&rsquo;s
heritage, but being ensamples to <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>the flock.&nbsp; And when the Chief
Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that
fadeth not away.&rdquo; <a name="citation199"></a><a
href="#footnote199" class="citation">[199]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;The
duty enjoined,&rdquo; writes the Archbishop, &ldquo;is, <i>Feed
the flock of God</i>.&nbsp; Every step of the way of our
salvation hath on it the print of infinite majesty, wisdom, and
goodness; and this among the rest, that men, sinful, weak men,
are made subservient in that great work of bringing Christ and
souls to meet; that by the foolishness of preaching (or what
appears so to carnal wisdom), the chosen of God are called, and
come unto Jesus, and are made <i>wise unto salvation</i>; and
that the life which is conveyed to them by the <i>word of
life</i>, in the hands of poor men, is by the same means
preserved and advanced.&nbsp; And this is the standing work of
the ministry, and this the thing here bound upon them that are
employed in it, <i>to feed the flock of God that is among
them</i>.&nbsp; Jesus Christ descended to purchase a Church, and
ascended to provide and furnish it, to send down his Spirit:
<i>He ascended</i>, <i>and gave gifts</i>, particularly <i>for
the work of the ministry</i>, and the great use of them is, <i>to
feed the flock of God</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to say any more of this usual resemblance of a
flock, importing the weakness and tenderness of the Church, the
continual need she stands in of inspection, and guidance, and
defence, and the <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>tender care of the Chief Shepherd for these things; the
phrase enforces the present duty of subordinate pastors; their
care and diligence in feeding of that flock.&nbsp; The due rule
of discipline not excluded, the main part of feeding is by
doctrine, leading them into the wholesome and <i>green
pastures</i> of saving truths, revealed in the Gospel,
accommodating the way of teaching to their condition and
capacity; to be, as much as may be, particularly acquainted with
it, and suit diligently and prudently their doctrine to it; to
<i>feed the sheep</i>, those more advanced; <i>to feed the
lambs</i>, the younger and weaker; to have special care of the
infirm; to learn of their Master the Great Shepherd, to <i>bind
up that which is broken</i>, <i>and strengthen that which is
sick</i>, <a name="citation200a"></a><a href="#footnote200a"
class="citation">[200a]</a> those that are broken in spirit, that
are exercised with temptations, <i>and gently to lead those that
are with young</i>, <a name="citation200b"></a><a
href="#footnote200b" class="citation">[200b]</a> in whom the
inward work of grace is as in the conception, and they heavy and
weak with the weight of it, and the many difficulties and
doubtings, which are frequent companions and symptoms of that
work.&nbsp; Oh! what dexterity and skilfulness, what diligence,
and above all, what affection, and bowels of compassion, are
needful for this task!&nbsp; <i>Who is sufficient for these
things</i>? <a name="citation200c"></a><a href="#footnote200c"
class="citation">[200c]</a>&nbsp; Who would not faint, and give
over in it, were not our Lord the <i>Chief Shepherd</i>; were not
all our sufficiency laid up <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>in His rich fulness, and all our
insufficiency covered in His gracious acceptance?&rdquo; <a
name="citation201"></a><a href="#footnote201"
class="citation">[201]</a>&nbsp; Animated by a high sense of
duty, and enlightened, strengthened, and guided by an abundant
outpouring of Divine grace, may all the &ldquo;pastors and
teachers,&rdquo; who have been ordained, &ldquo;For the
perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
edifying of the body of Christ;&rdquo; &ldquo;Preach the word, be
instant in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort,
with all long-suffering and doctrine;&rdquo; &ldquo;Till we all
come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son
of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of
the fulness of Christ: that we henceforth be no more children
tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine,
by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
wait to deceive: but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into
Him in all things which is the Head, even Christ: from whom the
whole body, fitly joined together, and compacted by that which
every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the
measure of every part, maketh increase of the body, unto the
edifying of itself in love.&rdquo;&nbsp; God grant that none of
His servants may faint or grow weary under the increased weight
of duty laid upon them by the circumstances of the times!&nbsp;
May they all labour, and &ldquo;pray without <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>ceasing for
the church and people of God,&mdash;remembering that the
effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth
much!&rdquo;&nbsp; When faithful to their great Master, they have
high encouragements to excite, holy consolations to cheer, and
heavenly aid to direct and bless their unremitting exertions in
His service, whose weak and &ldquo;unprofitable,&rdquo; but still
faithful and attached &ldquo;servants&rdquo; they are.&nbsp; Let
not any such fear but that they will obtain a blessing on their
labours, an answer to their prayers, from that gracious Being
whose ministers they are, and the advancement of whose kingdom
they seek.&nbsp; Never did the Lord fail his servants; His
&ldquo;exceeding great and precious promises&rdquo; are all sure
and steadfast, are all &ldquo;yea and in him, Amen.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;For He hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake
thee; so that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I
will not fear what man shall do unto me:&rdquo; <a
name="citation202a"></a><a href="#footnote202a"
class="citation">[202a]</a>&nbsp; He hath said, &ldquo;Lo, I am
with you alway, even unto the end of the world, Amen.&rdquo; <a
name="citation202b"></a><a href="#footnote202b"
class="citation">[202b]</a>&nbsp; May each individual pastor of
the Church of Christ have grace to receive and act upon, as
addressed to himself, the concluding admonition of St Paul to
Timothy: &ldquo;Watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do
the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy
ministry:&rdquo; then &ldquo;The Lord shall be unto thee an
everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.&rdquo; <a
name="citation202c"></a><a href="#footnote202c"
class="citation">[202c]</a>&nbsp; And <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>when the time of his earthly
stewardship is on the eve of completion,&mdash;the period of his
allotted ministry about to expire, then he may hope that upon his
last hours will be poured some portion of the joyful testimony of
an approving conscience; some measure of that blessed assurance
of confirmed faith, which cheered and supported the dying Hooker;
&ldquo;I plead not my righteousness, but the forgiveness of my
unrighteousness through His merits who died to purchase pardon
for penitent sinners.&nbsp; Let not mine, O Lord, but Thy will be
done!&nbsp; God hath heard my daily petitions; for I am at peace
with all men, and He is at peace with me.&nbsp; From such blessed
assurance, I feel that inward joy which this world can neither
give nor take from me.&nbsp; My conscience beareth me this
witness; and this witness makes the thoughts of death
joyful.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he may hope that the approach of the
dark shadows of death will be illumined by some beams of that
light from above, which, with the full blaze of triumphant faith,
shed a holy flood of radiance and glory over the close of the
ministry of the great Apostle of the Gentiles: &ldquo;I am now
ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at
hand.&nbsp; I have fought a good fight, I have finished my
course, I have kept the faith.&nbsp; Henceforth there is laid up
for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous
judge, <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but to
all those who love his appearing.&rdquo; <a
name="citation204a"></a><a href="#footnote204a"
class="citation">[204a]</a></p>
<p>Let the laity also be reminded of what they owe to God and
society at this eventful time.&nbsp; There are various modes by
which they can advance the cause of religion.&nbsp; The value of
their services in co-operation with the Clergy in forming
visiting societies, has been already stated.&nbsp; But as their
situation and engagements in life preclude many from taking an
active part in any work of Christian charity, it must be a high
satisfaction to them who are humble disciples of that blessed
Lord, &ldquo;who went about doing good,&rdquo; <a
name="citation204b"></a><a href="#footnote204b"
class="citation">[204b]</a> to have an opportunity of
endeavouring at once to follow His example, and obey His
commands, by means of public societies and institutions.&nbsp;
The best interests of man would be much promoted, if the noble,
and great, and affluent in the land, who fear God, would make a
more decided demonstration of their sentiments; and give the full
weight of their rank and influence, and contribute liberally, to
the support of societies, the object of which is the advancement
of true religion.&nbsp; In such times as the present, it is awful
to witness the apathy, supineness, and indifference in the cause
of the Lord, which prevail so extensively in the world, amongst
those who profess themselves to be His servants.&nbsp; <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>But
disregard for the spiritual wants of others, at all times highly
sinful, is doubly so now; and unwillingness, through fear of
ridicule or misconstruction, to manifest a warm zeal for the
honour of the Lord and a decided devotion to His cause&mdash;at
all times a wretched weakness&mdash;must, when His enemies are
active and powerful, be peculiarly offensive to Him, who has
said, &ldquo;Whosoever, therefore, shall be ashamed of me, and of
my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also
shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of
his Father with the holy angels.&rdquo; <a
name="citation205a"></a><a href="#footnote205a"
class="citation">[205a]</a>&nbsp; Let, therefore, all lukewarm
professors of religion be addressed in the words of Joshua,
&ldquo;If it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose this
day whom ye will serve:&rdquo; <a name="citation205b"></a><a
href="#footnote205b" class="citation">[205b]</a> let them be
warned in the words of the Saviour, &ldquo;He that is not with
me, is against me, and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth

class="citation">[205c]</a></p>
<p>It is the high and peculiar distinction of our country, that
we have not only charitable institutions for the prevention and
cure of many of the physical evils, and for the relief and solace
of many of the moral evils of life; but we have societies for the
supply of the religious wants of our home population, of our
colonies, and of the whole family of man, wherever British
commerce, and, with it, <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>British influence, extend.&nbsp;
This is not the place to enter upon the subject of all these
societies; their bare enumeration, with the most brief statement
of their several objects, would fill many pages; perhaps,
therefore, to particularize any, where all have merit, may be
deemed unjust towards others; but every consistent member of the
Church of England is bound strenuously to support, and every
clergyman zealously to advocate, societies, whose professed
object is the inculcation of doctrines which he firmly believes,
the use of a ritual which he fondly loves, the observance of
ordinances which he highly values and reverences.&nbsp; Of these
it may be right to make some brief notice, not only because some
of them have not received that encouragement and support to which
their importance entitles them, but because they are peculiarly
calculated to remedy the existence, and to prevent the
recurrence, of many of the evils which at present endanger our
civil and religious institutions.&nbsp; First in order stands the
National Society for promoting the education of the poor in the
principles of the Established Church.&nbsp; Then, ascending to a
higher grade in society, we have an institution, King&rsquo;s
College and School, to supply the youth of the middle classes, in
the metropolis, with a liberal education, founded on the basis of
religious knowledge.&nbsp; This institution is only in its
infancy, but if properly supported, it might extend its
ramifications <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>throughout the kingdom, diffusing every where the
beneficial fruit of true religion, sound learning, and useful
knowledge.&nbsp; It is much to be wished that similar colleges
and schools, in connexion with King&rsquo;s College, were
established in all our great towns, in like manner as schools
every where throughout the kingdom have sprung from that prolific
parent, with which they are in union, the Central School in
Baldwin&rsquo;s Gardens.&nbsp; Our National Schools are well
calculated early to train children in the path of godliness; to
accustom them to habits of cleanliness, neatness, and order; to
excite them to industry and application, to habituate them to
proper restraint and discipline, to supply them with the
knowledge suitable to their station in life; and, above all, to
impress deeply the mind with the great truths of the Gospel, and
to store it richly with passages of Scripture, which, once
thoroughly learnt, are rarely forgotten, but may, in after life,
prove in the hour of temptation a safeguard, and in seasons of
sickness or of sorrow, a sweet and never-failing solace.&nbsp; If
the minds of our manufacturing and agricultural population had
been fortified with the principles which are now instilled in
these schools, into the children of the poor, the success of the
teachers of infidelity and sedition would have been far different
from what it has unfortunately proved.&nbsp; The system of
instruction adopted in King&rsquo;s College <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>is
precisely the one which has been recommended as alone affording
any security that education will be rendered conducive to the
advancement of the best, the eternal interests of man.&nbsp;
Every facility is afforded for the acquisition of knowledge, but
the relative importance of its several departments is steadily
kept in view, and the balance of studies is carefully adjusted,
that, if possible, none may be pursued to the neglect of others,
but all receiving their due degree of attention, religion and
morals, literature and science, may occupy their proper place in
the plan of education.&nbsp; This institution, through the Divine
blessing, may be of great value in checking the progress of
unsettled and unsound opinions amongst a class of men which is
daily becoming more influential in society; whilst there will be
also a better safeguard for the future, in the foundation of
sound religious principles, which is designed to be laid; and
which should ever be a primary object, for not only is the
prevention easier than the cure, but the poison may spread where
the antidote is never, or fruitlessly, applied.&nbsp; If we view
then in connexion, our Infant, National, and Sunday Schools, in
full operation; King&rsquo;s College adapted to branch into
similar institutions in our great towns; and our old-established
Grammar Schools and Universities continuing to flourish; we shall
see that these are calculated to form one vast chain, <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>which, in
its concatenation, would unite the great bulk of the population
of the country with the established Church.</p>
<p>Nor is the attention of the Church confined to the education
of the youth of her communion.&nbsp; She has a Society also to
afford the poor adequate accommodation when attending religious
worship, of which, in some places, the great proportion of them
were long deprived, from the increase of population, and want of
free seats, in the parish churches.&nbsp; Parliament, with proper
liberality, has at different timed placed certain sums at the
disposal of Commissioners; to assist in remedying this great
evil, which has inflicted the severest injury on the moral and
religious character of the lower classes in England.&nbsp; Much
has, therefore, been done, but still more remains to be done; and
though perhaps the least regarded, still the Society for building
and enlarging churches is of great importance to the interests of
religion, and therefore well deserving of the support of the
friends of the Establishment.&nbsp; The valuable and venerable
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge completes the work of
Christian charity and instruction, by accompanying, as it were,
the poor man to his home, supplying, either gratuitously or at
very reduced prices, the Holy Scriptures, the book of common
prayer, and tracts and works designed to correct erroneous
opinions and immoral habits, and to promote soundness of faith <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>and
holiness of life.&nbsp; Nor is this the utmost limit of the
Society&rsquo;s labours among our home population: parochial
lending libraries have been also established by it; that in every
parish where the desire of knowledge has been called forth by the
national schools, works which combine amusement with
instruction&mdash;works which inform the head and improve the
heart&mdash;may be accessible, free of all cost to the poor man,
in his hour of leisure.&nbsp; It is thus these two most valuable
Societies, acting in co-operation, aid in the due and effective
discharge of their important duties the parochial clergy, who are
thereby enabled to diffuse amongst the indigent and ignorant of
their several parishes&mdash;to a degree far beyond what the
exertions of individuals, however pious and wealthy, are likely
to effect&mdash;the blessings of Christian education and
Christian knowledge.&nbsp; Great are the claims, therefore, of
these societies upon the members of the Church of England, for
their support, that all of her communion may be educated,
nourished, and preserved in those principles of saving faith and
holy obedience, which, drawn directly from Scripture, are summed
up in the articles, embodied in the liturgy, and explained in the
homilies of our pure and reformed branch of the church of
Christ.</p>
<p>The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge extends her
operations beyond our home population: in co-operation with the
Society for the Propagation <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, it
has laboured most diligently and with very encouraging success,
in the wide and waste field of our numerous colonies.&nbsp;
Missionaries, catechists, and schoolmasters, are sent into every
land where we have possessions; and congregations have been
formed and churches built where the glad tidings of the Gospel
had never before been heard.&nbsp; But, however cheering what has
been done and is doing for the spread of Christianity may be, the
painful confession must be made that this country has never yet,
in any adequate degree, discharged the religious obligations she
owes her colonies. <a name="citation211"></a><a
href="#footnote211" class="citation">[211]</a>&nbsp; The sceptre
of Great Britain rules over one hundred millions who are said to
be ignorant of the Gospel.&nbsp; Great and splendid have been the
instances of individual liberality, but as a nation we have not
made those strenuous exertions, those sacrifices which duty
requires: we have been unmindful of the heavy debt of gratitude
and service which we owe to the Ruler of nations.&nbsp; Why are
we to suppose that Divine Providence has bestowed upon us such a
vast colonial empire?&nbsp; Not to swell the pomp and <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>increase
the power and wealth of a little island, which has been proudly
styled,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;The Island, Empress of the
Sea:&rdquo;</p>
<p>but that we may be instruments in the hands of the Great and
Gracious Lord of the whole human race in benefiting
mankind.&nbsp; And how can we best accomplish this great
end?&nbsp; A Christian nation should make it an object of
paramount importance to diffuse the light of that Gospel, in
which it has itself for ages rejoiced as the best gift, the
holiest privilege, it enjoys at the hands of God.&nbsp; Has then
this Christian nation so acted?&nbsp; Alas! there is one
circumstance, which painfully occupies at this moment the
attention of the friends of Christianity, here and in India,
which may suffice to answer in the negative.&nbsp; Bishop after
bishop has been allowed to go forth, with the spirit of a martyr,
and to meet a martyr&rsquo;s death in India, where the diocese is
admitted by all to be so extensive, that the strongest
constitution must, from the effects of the climate, sink under
even an imperfect discharge of the overwhelming load of
duty.&nbsp; And yet repeated applications for the appointment of
bishops to the several presidencies, by which the cause of
religion amongst the Christian, and the spread of the Gospel
amongst the Heathen population, would be very greatly advanced,
have been up to this time refused, it is much to be feared, from
an unwillingness to incur <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>the expense of further episcopal
appointments.&nbsp; May Bishop Turner be the last, who, humanly
speaking, is to be thus sacrificed!&nbsp; For it would inflict a
heavy load of sin upon a Christian people to be not only lavish
of life, of talents, and of piety, but to prefer to the cause of
God, who has so abundantly blessed us, an economy, which, however
wise and proper when rightly practised, becomes miserable and
wicked when allowed to operate to the hinderance of the
Gospel.&nbsp; An appeal is never made in vain to the good
feelings of the people of England, and the present is an
occasion, on which all who value not merely the cause of
religion, but of humanity, should make a declaration of their
opinions; and come forward liberally to the support of Societies
whose object is so important and praiseworthy, and whose means
are so inadequate to several claims upon them.&nbsp; The reports
of the Societies for Promoting Christian Knowledge, and for the
Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, for the year 1831,
cannot be too strongly recommended to the attention of the
public.&nbsp; The comparatively small support which the latter
receives from annual subscription must be mainly ascribed to the
nature and extent of its labours being so little known; for it is
not the character of the English people to allow a valuable
Society to languish from want of funds.&nbsp; And yet, during the
past year, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in
Foreign Parts must have <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>suspended in some places the great
work it is carrying on, if it had not allowed its expenditure to
exceed greatly its receipts.&nbsp; Such is the sad truth we learn
from the report now before the public, which pleads the cause of
Christianity in distant lands, so powerfully, and yet so meekly,
that it cannot fail to awaken sympathy in every religious breast,
and call forth assistance from every liberal hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;According to its power, yea, and beyond its power,&rdquo;
it has opened the hand of Christian bounty in answer to the
numerous and pressing calls that have been made upon it: and the
consequence has been that the means of meeting such calls have
become every year more insufficient.&nbsp; Even on the
supposition (a supposition, however, which benevolence will not
allow to be entertained for a moment), that all new applications
for its assistance are to be disregarded, the Society will
require an addition of at least 10,000<i>l.</i> to its yearly
income for the fulfilment of engagements into which it has
entered.&nbsp; Its deficiencies for many years have been supplied
by large reductions of its capital.&nbsp; The single fact that it
has been compelled to sell nearly 70,000<i>l.</i> stock must fill
its friends with serious uneasiness.&nbsp; For unless its funds
are very largely increased, it is manifest that they must soon be
exhausted.&nbsp; But, surely, so sad a result can never be
allowed!&nbsp; There is too much benevolence in the Christian
public of this favoured nation, to permit the abandonment of so
great a work as that by which the light of the <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>Gospel, in
its purity, is communicated to the benighted nations of the
East.&nbsp; Who among us will be wanting, in most earnest
efforts, to save our brethren in the colonies from so sad an
injury as the loss of that religious instruction, and those means
of grace which are to be regarded as their birthright?&nbsp; Who
will allow the many excellent men who have left their native
country as missionaries, with the purest zeal, and the most
earnest desire to promote the spiritual welfare of their
fellow-creatures, through incessant toil in distant lands, to be
deprived of the moderate but necessary support, that has hitherto
been afforded by this Society?&nbsp; Who will allow the no less
valuable persons, who have been diligently trained in the
colonies, almost from their cradles, to carry forward the same
Christian designs, as missionaries, and catechists, and
school-masters, to be now cast upon the world, and exposed to all
the miseries of want?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall be said, if it fail of attaining its full
measure of good, through the indifference of those whom God has
not only &lsquo;blessed with all spiritual blessings in
Christ,&rsquo; but to whom He has also largely afforded the
temporal means of imparting those blessings to others?&nbsp; What
shall be said if they, who by the abundant mercy of God are
themselves supplied with the bread of life, suffer their
fellow-creatures, whose necessities are plainly pointed out to
them, to perish with hunger?&nbsp; Your committee will not
contemplate the possibility of <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>such a deplorable case as
this.&nbsp; Grateful for the support which the Society has
already received, and through which it has been enabled to effect
so much, they will not allow themselves to doubt, but that
Providence will now, and from time to time, raise it up friends
who will furnish it with more ample and effectual means for the
continuance and extension of its &lsquo;labours of
love.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every friend of religion must earnestly pray that a hope so
humbly and devoutly expressed may be fulfilled, and that the Lord
may bless and prosper these Societies, in sowing the good seed of
the word, in a field of immense extent, and, in many parts, of
the most unpromising barrenness.&nbsp; For they embrace&mdash;to
particularize only the most important missions&mdash;the widely
dispersed population of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the
Canadas; the numerous islands of the West Indies; the great
Peninsula of India; and the various settlements in
Australia.&nbsp; And it is gratifying and highly satisfactory to
be able to quote the impartial testimony of a distinguished
individual, the late Governor of Nova Scotia, to their efficiency
and value: &ldquo;In countries in which I have resided, and which
I have visited&mdash;in remote and almost desert places, I have
witnessed the blessings and comforts of our holy religion,
dispensed, by your servants, to persons who otherwise might pass
from the cradle to the grave, without the blessings or benefits,
the comforts or the consolations of any appropriate holy office,
to <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>sanctify their entrance into life, to receive them into
the Christian family, to solemnize those connexions, on the
proper observance of which the moral constitution of society
essentially depends, and finally to perform the last sad offices
over departed humanity.&nbsp; In my own person&mdash;in my own
family&mdash;in visitations the most awful&mdash;in severe
domestic affliction, I have partaken of those blessings and
consolations, administered by your servants.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let,
therefore, the parliament and people of the United Kingdom
contribute liberally, not merely towards the continuance, but the
extension, of the important labours of a Society, whose only
fault has been,&mdash;if it be a fault,&mdash;that it has so
shrunk from any appearance of obtruding its wants, that it has
not sufficiently made known its claims upon the friends of
religion; who must be at once desirous that our countrymen in our
distant dependencies should not be debarred from the exercise of
religious worship; and that the light of the Gospel may be shed
upon those, who, though living under the government of Great
Britain, are lying in darkness and the shadow of death.&nbsp; And
if there be any whose hearts expand not with that diffusive
spirit of Christian philanthropy, which ardently desires to
promote the spiritual welfare of the whole human race; let them
at least be sensible to the religious wants, and alive to the
religious improvement of their countrymen, who are established in
some of the numerous colonies of this vast empire.&nbsp; In this
great commercial <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>country, in which the spirit of enterprise or the calls
of duty lead so many forth often at an early age into distant
lands, there must be an immense number of influential persons,
who have a direct interest in this provision for the religious
instruction of the residents in our several dependencies.&nbsp;
And oh! how consolatory must it prove to the heart of a parent,
or even of a friend, who sends forth a youth to seek his fortune
far from friends, kindred, and home, to know that he will not be
deprived of the public exercise of those religious duties in
which he has been early trained.&nbsp; Oh! how immeasurably would
the pain of separation, which may be for life&mdash;which may be
for ever&mdash;be increased, if there was a melancholy certainty,
that at the most dangerous period of life, when the passions are
strong, the judgment weak, and the principles often unsettled;
and where the temptations to sensual indulgences abound, and the
restraints of parental authority are removed; there was no
religious monitor, no duly ordained pastor, to instruct in
health, to cheer in sorrow, to strengthen in sickness, and, it
may be, to support and console in death, those who are pursuing
an useful and honourable course far from their dearest earthly
ties, far from what is ever dear to the heart of all&mdash;their
native land&mdash;the land of their fathers.</p>
<p>In entering thus more at length on the subject of the Society
for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts than on any
other Society, an exception <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>has been made in its favour, because
it has never yet received that encouragement and support to which
its most important object and valuable labours so well entitle
it: but imperfect as the notice of other Societies has been, it
would be still more so if concluded without any mention of the
Church Missionary Society, and the British and Foreign Bible
Society.&nbsp; The first of these is formed with the design of
endeavouring to obey to the fullest extent the parting command of
our blessed Lord, &ldquo;Go ye into all the world, and preach the
Gospel to every creature:&rdquo; <a name="citation219"></a><a
href="#footnote219" class="citation">[219]</a> it is not confined
by any limits, but wherever the opening presents itself, thither
the indefatigable, zealous, and faithful missionary is sent: and
the Lord has greatly prospered their labours.&nbsp; The latter,
whether we regard its scope or its machinery, is a mighty and
wonderful engine, capable of producing immense benefit to the
whole human race: its scope is not merely the supply of the
inhabitants of the British dominions with the Scriptures, but
their translation into every language, their dissemination in
every land; and its vast and complicated machinery has been put
into operation in every quarter of the globe.&nbsp; It may
suffice to state, that the grand, the beneficent, and most
Christian end, which these two Societies have in view, is to
evangelize the world: the one sends its <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>missionary
either instructed, or to be instructed, in the language of the
country where is to be his field in which he is to sow the good
seed of the word of life; and the other supplies the sower with
that seed of the word of life translated into the language of the
country.&nbsp; The difficulties they have to encounter are
immense; and the danger of the neglect of the legitimate object,
or of perversion of the power and means of these Societies, may
be considerable; but still the enterprise of Christian love is
not to be abandoned, because it is difficult; nor the means of
Christian usefulness sacrificed, because they are capable of
abuse: rather let those who rejoice in the light of the Gospel,
and thank God every day of their lives for having the high
privilege of reading His Book, labour to provide missionaries so
well fitted for their office, as to afford reasonable hope that
through Him, on whose assistance and blessing they alone depend,
they may surmount the many and arduous difficulties which impede
their progress: rather let them exercise increased vigilance, and
employ greater care and attention, that if any error exist, it
may be corrected, that if any abuse has crept in, it may be
reformed.&nbsp; Let these Societies be only faithful to their
trust&mdash;true to the one great object they are ever to keep in
view, and they may fully rely upon Him, whose kingdom they labour
to advance, whose word they seek to publish&mdash;to bless their
work and <a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>ensure their success.&nbsp; But let them remember that
no unsound principles of expediency, no unworthy means to excite
popularity, or to gain support, must be had recourse to; such
would be to apply to their goodly edifices the &ldquo;untempered
mortar,&rdquo; which would end in their destruction: let them go
forth in the strength of the Lord, and in his strength only; let
them seek the extension of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, and of His
kingdom only; and then all who love the Lord&rsquo;s Christ,
honour His name, and seek to promote His glory&mdash;if they can
do no more, will at least say, we &ldquo;bid you God
speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The increasing exertions which are making, in this country,
for the diffusion of vital religion amongst Christians, and for
the spread of the Gospel amongst the heathen, will form one of
the brightest pages in its history.&nbsp; And truly at this
moment it presents almost the only subject on which the
Christian&rsquo;s anxious eye can rest with unmixed satisfaction
and with joyful hope.&nbsp; The prospect around is in many parts
dark and discouraging, but in one direction is illumined by a
bright and holy light&mdash;&ldquo;the sun of righteousness
arising with healing in his wings,&rdquo; upon the &ldquo;nations
which sit in darkness and the shadow of death.&rdquo; <a
name="citation221"></a><a href="#footnote221"
class="citation">[221]</a>&nbsp; England appears to be selected
by God for this great and glorious work.&nbsp; As the Roman <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>Empire was
raised up and employed by the Great Governor of the Universe for
the first promulgation of the Gospel; and as the Greek language
was made the medium through which that Gospel was extensively
diffused: so we may hope that the British Empire, so greatly
increased, may be employed, and the English language, so widely
spread, be made a medium, for that final promulgation which is to
take place, and the result of which is to be thus
complete&mdash;&ldquo;the earth shall be full of the knowledge of
the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.&rdquo; <a
name="citation222"></a><a href="#footnote222"
class="citation">[222]</a>&nbsp; But however this may
be&mdash;for ill does it become short-sighted man to speculate on
the unfulfilled prophecies of Holy Writ&mdash;our line of duty is
plain: we must make the most strenuous exertions, trusting to be
instruments in the hands of the Almighty in the conversion of the
heathen.&nbsp; The labour of love, which springs from gratitude
to God, which is directed by faith in His promises and animated
by hope of His blessing, will never be fruitless: if it please
not the Divine Providence to give it a prosperous issue to those
for whose benefit it was designed, it will return as a
blessing&mdash;&ldquo;good measure, pressed down, and shaken
together, and running over&rdquo;&mdash;into the bosoms of those,
who planned, supported, and conducted it, with a sole view to
God&rsquo;s glory and the salvation of <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>men.&nbsp;
This physical pestilence has travelled from India to England:
does it not in awful terms reproach us, for having, as a nation,
done so little to arrest and heal the moral pestilence which
rages throughout that great Peninsula?&nbsp; Oh! let every means
be used by the friends of religion to rouse a sinful people to a
due sense of what they owe to their home population, to their
colonies, and to the world at large.&nbsp; Whatever be the
channel in which an individual may wish the stream of his bounty
to flow, he will find Societies through which he will best
accomplish the good he has in view.&nbsp; Let, therefore, all be
active, liberal, and zealous, in the cause of religion: let all,
according to the ability which God supplieth, endeavour to
promote the present and eternal welfare of all mankind!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Charge them,&rdquo; says St. Paul, &ldquo;who are rich in
this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain
riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to
enjoy: that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready
to distribute, willing to communicate: laying up in store for
themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they
may lay hold on eternal life.&rdquo; <a name="citation223"></a><a
href="#footnote223" class="citation">[223]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;But
this I say, he which soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly:
and he which soweth bountifully, shall reap also
bountifully.&nbsp; Every man <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>according as he purposeth in his
heart, so let him give, not grudgingly or of necessity, for God
loveth a cheerful giver.&nbsp; And God is able to make all grace
abound towards you; that ye always having all-sufficiency in all
things, may abound to every good work.&rdquo; <a
name="citation224a"></a><a href="#footnote224a"
class="citation">[224a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Let every one that
nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity:&rdquo; let all in
their several vocations endeavour to improve, to the spiritual
advantage of themselves and others, this Divine visitation; that
thus its great object being accomplished&mdash;for the language
of God&rsquo;s chastisements, whether national or individual, is
&ldquo;be zealous and repent,&rdquo;&mdash;we may humbly hope
that our gracious Lord God will be pleased to withdraw His heavy
hand from His humbled and contrite people; the duty of each of
whom has been shown to be, to effect, through the Divine
blessing, a personal reformation; for the sins of each individual
form fractions of the immense integral of national guilt, which
has called down the Divine displeasure; to employ their rank,
influence, and a due proportion of their wealth, in labouring to
advance, by their personal exertions, and through the medium of
societies, a national reformation; and to diffuse throughout the
world the knowledge of the Saviour, that &ldquo;the kingdoms of
this world may become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of His
Christ.&rdquo; <a name="citation224b"></a><a href="#footnote224b"
class="citation">[224b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>And
how are they to be addressed who are the enemies of the Lord and
of His Christ&mdash;who trample under foot his cross, and, at
present, stand excluded from all benefit of the great atonement
by &ldquo;counting the blood of the covenant an unholy
thing&rdquo;&mdash;how are they to be addressed who deny the Lord
who bought them, and secretly maintain, or openly espouse, the
doctrines of infidelity?&nbsp; In the language of friendly
warning and exhortation.&nbsp; Sometimes the Christian advocate
has erred by employing a tone of conscious superiority, of cold
severity, or of keen satire: the first offends, the second
hardens, the third irritates the proud spirit of unbelief: the
voice of remonstrance is often listened to, when authority
commands in vain.&nbsp; Let, therefore, whatever has been said,
in these pages, be considered, not as intended in the least
degree to wound or insult the feelings of any one, but as written
in the honest and faithful discharge of Christian duty.&nbsp; And
in the spirit of meekness and charity let me entreat those, who
reject Christianity, to pause, reflect, and examine deeply into
the grounds on which they have come to a decision which involves
their eternal destiny.&nbsp; Let me ask them whether they have
ever duly considered, first, <i>the possibility of Revelation
being true</i>; and, secondly, <i>the consequences of Revelation
being true</i>.&nbsp; Surely a creed, which numbers amongst its
defenders laymen, who hold the highest place in England&rsquo;s
proud <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>annals of science and philosophy, is not lightly to be
rejected by ordinary minds: surely where Bacon, Milton, Boyle,
Locke, and Newton, have been believers, there is room to admit
<i>the possibility</i> of the creed being true.&nbsp; When
intellects of the most powerful grasp, disciplined by the most
arduous studies, and stored with the richest fruits of human
knowledge, have received with humility, gratitude, reverence, and
faith, the Bible, as the inspired Word of God, some doubts may
flash across the mind of the infidel, as to whether he has
arrived at a just conclusion, in refusing to believe that
Bible.&nbsp; And oh! if there do arise a doubt, let him now be
entreated to re-examine this most important subject, on which the
interests of eternity depend; to reconsider the grounds on which
he denies a faith in which, during eighteen hundred years,
millions have lived and died.</p>
<p>There is, however, a second point of consideration, and that a
very important one, which ought not to be lost sight of, <i>the
consequences of Revelation being true</i>,&mdash;the unutterable
anguish of hopeless, endless despair and torment.&nbsp; Infidels
often speak with much levity, and sometimes with profaneness, of
the awful punishments of a future world, denounced in Scripture
against impenitent guilt; but, if they searched deeply into their
own hearts, they would find not only that they were less happy
than they were before they shook off their <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>belief in
Revelation; but some might discover, almost, the commencement of
the gnawing of the undying worm.&nbsp; In health, this may be
scarcely perceived, but when the hour approaches, which generally
tears away the mask which has concealed internal feelings long
kept secret, the hideousness of infidelity is fully seen.&nbsp;
Some appear to have acted their part to the last; thus Hume was
said to have spent some of his latter hours in reading &ldquo;the
Dialogues of the Dead,&rdquo; of the Apostate Lucian; but what an
employment for one who professed to be a philosopher!&nbsp; At a
time, when the eyes are about to close for ever on all that the
heart has held dear in life, &ldquo;drollery, in such
circumstances, is neither more nor less than</p>
<blockquote><p>Moody madness, laughing wild<br />
Amidst severest woe.&rdquo; <a name="citation227"></a><a
href="#footnote227" class="citation">[227]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But such cases are, generally, of rare, occurrence: as the
sombre shades of the evening of life gathered around Gibbon, this
melancholy confession escaped him,&mdash;the past is gone, the
present is but for a moment, and the prospect of the future is
dark and doubtful.&nbsp; Paine, who had vauntingly proclaimed,
that, during an illness, expected by himself and those around him
to be fatal, he had rejoiced that he had published his Age of
Reason, when the hour of death really arrived, endured all the
agonies <a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>of remorse, evincing a horrible combination of awakened
terror and blasphemous despair.&nbsp; And that renowned champion
of infidelity, Voltaire, who was smitten, in his hour of pride
and triumph, suffered in his last hours such intolerable anguish
and such overwhelming terror, that the alarmed physician
declared, that the furies of Orestes could not equal the horrors
of such a death-bed.</p>
<p>Should the consideration of the possibility and consequences
of the truth of Revelation, and of the certainty of the present
wretchedness of infidelity, awaken in some readers feelings of
apprehension,&mdash;lest, whilst in imagination they have been
releasing themselves from the trammels of superstition, they have
in reality been fastening round their own necks the heavy yoke of
that hard task-master, the great enemy of the human race; let
them be entreated to institute now a strict enquiry as to the
unanswerableness of the objections against Revelation, on the
strength of which they have withheld their belief; and as to the
certainty of those conclusions of unassisted reason, on which
they have been content to build their opinions as to an
hereafter, unmindful that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dim as the borrowed beams of moon and
stars<br />
To lonely, weary, wandering travellers,<br />
Is reason to the soul.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alas! it is melancholy to think how many reject <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>Christianity without due examination: but let the
infidel be assured that, whether he is involved in the mazy
labyrinth of metaphysical subtleties, perplexed with the false
conclusions of materialism, startled by the apparent extent of
physical and moral evil, or offended, with the multitude of
sceptics, at mysteries, creeds, and articles; he will find
answers to all his objections and difficulties in the various
treatises which have been written on the evidences of
Christianity.&nbsp; But let him not enter upon the subject with a
prejudiced mind, in the pride of human reason, or under the
influence of human passions.&nbsp; Is it likely that the Great
Author of light and life will vouchsafe to illuminate
understandings, which prejudice darkens, and pride renders
presumptuous; or convert and sanctify hearts, which sensuality
debases and pollutes?&nbsp; They who approach the Great Governor
of the Universe to be instructed, in what belongs to their
everlasting peace, must come with humility, reverence, and awe;
they must strive to divest themselves of prepossession,
prejudice, and passion; and pray to be guided unto all truth: and
if they persevere in patient and dispassionate examination of the
evidences of Christianity, and in an humble and careful study of
the Scriptures themselves, accompanied with sincere and earnest
prayers, in God&rsquo;s good time, the light of Divine grace will
break upon their darkened understandings; they will see how <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>wonderfully
the conflicting attributes of justice and mercy have been
reconciled in the Divine plan for the restoration of a guilty
world to the favour of its offended God; they will be filled with
devout admiration of that love of God, which passeth all
understanding, which has provided for the most heinous offenders
a means of escape from eternal condemnation; and they will
thankfully and joyfully embrace the offers of salvation through
the Saviour, published in the Gospel.</p>
<p>But if there be any who refuse to return to the God of their
youth; any who close their ears against every admonition to
examine, deeply, into those principles of infidelity, which they
have adopted,&mdash;principles too dear to man&rsquo;s natural
pride, too favourable to his natural corruption, to be willingly
or easily resigned&mdash;let them at least be persuaded not to
attempt to make proselytes to their creed.&nbsp; The time may
come when they shall be convinced of the truth of Christianity;
and oh! how will the weight of guilt, which, in the sad and dark
hour of a late repentance, almost overwhelms the soul, be
increased, if they have been instrumental in destroying the
belief of others, which they have not the power to restore!&nbsp;
There is no crime of so deep a die as the ruin of an immortal
soul; none which subjects to the same dreadful remorse; none
which presents the same terrible impediment to our obtaining
pardon and peace: for what present <a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>peace can there be to him, who sees
one soul exposed to eternal condemnation, through his
means?&nbsp; What to him who sees many?&nbsp; What to him, who
has the agonising conviction ever present to his mind, that he
has no longer the power to attempt to repair the evil he has
done, for they have been summoned to judgment, whom he had led
astray?&nbsp; There is also another consideration which may have
some weight with those who promulgate infidel doctrines, which
is, that they blast the present as well as eternal happiness of
their miserable converts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps our modern
sceptics are ignorant, that without the belief of a God and the
hope of immortality, the miseries of human life would often be
insupportable.&nbsp; Yet this I must suppose, or I must believe
them to be the most cruel, the most perfidious, and the most
profligate of men.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is most true, that if you rob
a man of his religious principles, you deprive him of what
&ldquo;has both the promise of the life which now is, and of that
which is to come,&rdquo; his peace of mind, his trust in
God&rsquo;s protection, his faith in the Saviour, his hope of
glory, all that consoles, improves, elevates, and ennobles our
nature&mdash;all are gone, and in their place are substituted
lawless passions, disappointed hopes, and bitter regrets.&nbsp;
If, therefore, no other consideration will avail to induce the
infidel school to forego their plans of proselytism, let regard
for their philanthropy, of which they make <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>such boast,
be urged to prevent their rendering men less happy than they are
at present, under the mild and benignant rule of
Christianity.&nbsp; May that blessed Lord, who &ldquo;willeth not
the death of a sinner, but rather that he should be converted and
live, have mercy upon all infidels and heretics, and so fetch
them home to His flock, that they may be made one fold under one
shepherd, Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duty of a Christian people, under Divine visitations,
however feebly, has been faithfully stated, according to the
conscientious belief of the writer: may He, in dependence upon
whose blessing, and to promote whose kingdom it has been written,
make it instrumental to the production of a religious improvement
of the afflictive dispensation sent upon the land.&nbsp; The
nature of the disease has ceased to be doubtful, and the
pestilence which has been so long advancing towards us is
admitted now by all to have reached our shores.&nbsp; Once more,
then, let the question be asked, &ldquo;What will ye do in the
day of visitation when your desolation shall come from far, to
whom will ye flee for help?&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh that one simultaneous
cry would respond from the inhabitants of this
kingdom&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">We will trust in the
lord for ever</span>, <span class="smcap">for in the lord jehovah
is everlasting strength</span>!&rdquo;&nbsp; When Solomon, on the
dedication of the temple, prayed, &ldquo;If there be in the land
famine, if there be pestilence, or whatsoever <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>sickness
there be: then what prayer and supplication soever be made by any
man or by all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his
own sin, and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in
this house; then hear Thou in heaven, Thy dwelling-place, and
forgive, and render to every man according unto all his ways,
whose heart Thou knowest, for Thou only knowest the hearts of all
men.&rdquo; <a name="citation233a"></a><a href="#footnote233a"
class="citation">[233a]</a>&nbsp; The Lord returned the gracious
answer: &ldquo;I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this
place to myself for an house of sacrifice.&nbsp; If I shut up
heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to
devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people: if my
people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves and
pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then
will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will
heal their land.&rdquo; <a name="citation233b"></a><a
href="#footnote233b" class="citation">[233b]</a></p>
<p>Prayers, set forth by authority, are offered up to the throne
of grace, throughout the kingdom, and it has pleased the Almighty
to deal graciously with His people, in mitigating the virulence
of the pestilence: let a fast be proclaimed, that on an appointed
day the whole nation may &ldquo;humble themselves, and pray, and
seek the Lord&rsquo;s face:&rdquo; let associations be formed to
assist the ministers of God&rsquo;s Word and Sacraments, to
exhort and entreat the <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>people to &ldquo;turn from their
wicked ways:&rdquo; and if &ldquo;the Lord&rsquo;s people, which
are called by His name,&rdquo; humbled and contrite turn unto
Him, with all their hearts, and with mourning and fasting, and
cry, &ldquo;Spare us, O Lord, spare Thy people, whom Thou hast
redeemed with Thy most precious blood; turn us, O God of our
salvation, and cause Thine anger towards us to cease;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Righteous art Thou, O Lord, and just are Thy
judgments:&rdquo; if they &ldquo;cease to do evil, and learn to
do well,&rdquo; then in God&rsquo;s good time the gracious
promise will be fulfilled, for &ldquo;the mouth of the Lord hath
spoken it,&rdquo;&mdash;I <span class="smcap">will hear from
heaven</span>, <span class="smcap">and will forgive their
sin</span>, <span class="smcap">and will heal their
land</span>.</p>
<p>Oh may it not be, that the wickedness of the land shall avert
from it the mercy and blessing of the Most High!&nbsp; May it not
be, that the fearful words shall become applicable to us,
&ldquo;Thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, in
returning and rest shall ye be saved, in quietness and in
confidence shall be your strength; and ye would not!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Oh! rather may &ldquo;the spirit of grace and
supplications&rdquo; be poured upon the people, for &ldquo;Will
the Lord wait that He may be gracious unto you, and therefore
will He be exalted, that He may have mercy upon you: for the Lord
is a God of judgment; blessed are all they that wait for
Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then shall the Lord&rsquo;s people derive joy
and peace from those transporting words of comfort: &ldquo;For a
<a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>small
moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather
thee.&nbsp; In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a
moment, but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee,
saith the Lord Thy Redeemer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s judgments are in the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
many places there has been a literal fulfilment of those terrible
predictions, the application of which is not to be considered
limited to any time or nation: &ldquo;All joy is darkened, the
mirth of the land is gone: in the city is left desolation, and
the gate is smitten with destruction.&rdquo; <a
name="citation235a"></a><a href="#footnote235a"
class="citation">[235a]</a>&nbsp; Truly in our case it may be
said, &ldquo;the isles saw it and feared, the ends of the earth
were afraid.&rdquo; <a name="citation235b"></a><a
href="#footnote235b" class="citation">[235b]</a>&nbsp; Oh!
without experiencing the extreme severity of the scourge, may
this nation learn the lesson it is meant to teach!&nbsp;
&ldquo;They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the
majesty of the Lord, they shall cry aloud from the sea.&nbsp;
Wherefore glorify ye the Lord; even the name of the Lord God of
Israel, in the isles of the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Trust in the
Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous
redemption.&rdquo;&nbsp; Proclaim every where &ldquo;God is our
hope and strength,&rdquo; a &ldquo;sure refuge in the day of
trouble.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then shall the inhabitants of the
world learn righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then shall they know that
&ldquo;the Lord is a very present help in trouble; blessed are <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>the people
whose trust is in Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, God grant that it may
be said of this land, long favoured and blest of heaven, thou
&ldquo;hast glorified God in the day of visitation;&rdquo; <a
name="citation236a"></a><a href="#footnote236a"
class="citation">[236a]</a> therefore, thou shalt &ldquo;obtain
gladness and joy, and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.&rdquo;
<a name="citation236b"></a><a href="#footnote236b"
class="citation">[236b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Then shall thy light
break forth as the morning, and thy health shall spring forth
speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee, the glory
of the Lord shall be thy rere-ward.&nbsp; Then shalt thou call,
and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and He shall say,
<span class="smcap">here i am</span>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation236c"></a><a href="#footnote236c"
class="citation">[236c]</a></p>
<p>May God, whose gracious and never-failing Providence orders
all things both in heaven and earth, of His infinite mercy,
accomplish this great end of all His visitations, that we may
become a &ldquo;righteous nation unto the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; May
those who are slumbering in the fatal lethargy of sin
&ldquo;awake to righteousness and sin not:&rdquo; alarmed by the
judgments impending over them, may habitual sinners seek for
grace, &ldquo;to turn from the evil of their ways,&rdquo; before
&ldquo;the Lord be revealed from heaven, in flaming fire, taking
vengeance on the wicked, and those who know not God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
May the lukewarm, who, even in the hour of danger, still
&ldquo;halt between two opinions,&rdquo; cleave to the Lord, lest
their souls should be required of them, whilst yet balancing the
claims of God and mammon.&nbsp; May the faithful <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>trim their
lamps, &ldquo;have their loins girded, and their lights burning,
and be like unto men that wait for their Lord: blessed are those
servants whom the Lord when he cometh shall find
watching.&rdquo;&nbsp; And may God pour His especial grace and
blessing upon the nation at large: that all may recognize His
hand, submit to His will, depend on His protection, profit by His
chastisements, and endeavour to promote His glory here and
abroad, now and for ever.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now the God of peace that
brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that Great Shepherd
of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make
you perfect in every good work to do His will, working in you
that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ,
to whom be glory for ever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo; <a

<h2><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>A
PRAYER<br />
<span class="GutSmall">IN TIMES OF</span><br />
PESTILENCE OR GREAT SICKNESS.</h2>
<p>O <span class="smcap">Almighty</span> and Everlasting God,
whose gracious and never-failing Providence orders all things,
both in heaven and earth; we, Thy unworthy servants, most humbly
beseech Thee, to look with an eye of pity upon thy afflicted
people.&nbsp; We have sinned, O Lord, and done wickedly; in the
days of our prosperity we have forgotten Thee, the bounteous
Giver of all good: but Thou dealest not with the sons of men
after their sins, nor rewardest them according to their
iniquities.&nbsp; Have mercy, therefore, upon us, O God,
according to Thy loving-kindness: according unto the multitude of
Thy tender mercies, blot out our transgressions.&nbsp; We know, O
Lord, that Thy judgments are right, and that Thou, in
faithfulness, hast afflicted us.&nbsp; But, O Lord, rebuke us not
in Thy wrath, neither chasten us in Thy hot displeasure.&nbsp;
Let mercy rejoice against judgment.&nbsp; And turn Thee unto us,
and have mercy upon us: for we are desolate and afflicted.&nbsp;
The troubles of our heart are enlarged: oh bring Thou us out of
our distresses.&nbsp; Look upon our affliction and our pain, and
forgive all our sins.</p>
<p>O Heavenly Father, our only dependence is upon Thy
compassion.&nbsp; Thou art merciful and gracious, slow to anger,
and plenteous in mercy.&nbsp; For Thou knowest our <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>frame; Thou
rememberest that we are dust.&nbsp; We come before Thee,
therefore, trusting in the multitude of Thy mercies, and
encouraged by the abundance of Thy great and precious
promises.&nbsp; Incline Thine ear, O Lord, and hear the
supplications of Thy people.&nbsp; Turn us, O God of our
salvation, and cause Thine anger towards us to cease.&nbsp; Of
Thy only gift it cometh that Thy people can do unto Thee true and
acceptable service.&nbsp; Pour, therefore, we humbly beseech
Thee, upon this land, the spirit of grace and supplication, the
spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of the Lord,
that it may know, in this its day, the things which belong unto
its peace; and may flee to Thee for deliverance from the floods
of immorality, profaneness, and infidelity, which threaten to
overflow its borders.&nbsp; O Almighty God, who alone canst order
the unruly wills and affections of sinful men, shed abroad, in
the minds and hearts of this people, the enlightening, renewing,
and sanctifying influence of Thy grace, that, recognising Thy
judgments, submitting to Thy will, and profiting by Thy
chastisements, we may humble ourselves under Thy mighty hand; and
putting away from us the evil of our ways, may turn unto Thee
with all our heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with
mourning.&nbsp; And then, O merciful and long-suffering Lord, who
willest not the death of a sinner, but rather that all should
repent and live; spare us, good Lord, oh spare Thy people, whom
Thou hast redeemed with Thy precious blood; and hear from Heaven,
we implore Thee, and forgive our sin, and heal our land.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we earnestly address Thee, O gracious God, whose
kingdom ruleth over all, in behalf of the whole race of
mankind.&nbsp; Be pleased, of Thy great goodness, to grant, that
now, when Thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>of the
world may learn righteousness: and in every land they may receive
grace to glorify Thee in the day of visitation.&nbsp; Oh bless
and prosper, we pray Thee, the means employed for the spread of
the light of Thy Holy Gospel, here and abroad,&mdash;for the
promotion of Thy glory, and the extension of Thy kingdom.&nbsp;
That, in Thy good time, the kingdoms of this world may become the
kingdoms of our Lord, and of His Christ.</p>
<p>Finally, we beseech Thee, of Thy goodness, O Lord, to comfort
and succour all them, who, in this transitory life, are in
trouble, sorrow, need, sickness, or any other
adversity;&mdash;more especially those who are set in the midst
of so many and great dangers, by reason of the pestilence which
it hath pleased Thee to send upon the land.&nbsp; Oh be Thou unto
all Thy servants a refuge and strength, a very present help in
trouble.&nbsp; Be merciful unto us, O God, be merciful unto us,
for our souls trust in Thee; yea in the shadow of thy wings will
we make our refuge, until these calamities be overpast.&nbsp;
Thou art our hope and our stronghold, our God, in Thee will we
trust.&nbsp; O Lord, who art rich in mercy and goodness, suffer
not, we entreat Thee, any evil to happen to us, neither any
plague to come nigh our dwelling.&nbsp; And graciously produce in
us such firm trust in thy mighty aid, amid all the trials and
dangers of this mortal life, and such a blessed assurance, that,
under Thy divine control, all things shall work together for our
eternal good, that we may not be afraid for the terror by night,
nor the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that
walketh in darkness, nor for the destruction that wasteth at
noon-day.&nbsp; But that filled with joy and peace in believing,
we may rest with humble and firm dependence, Heavenly Father,
upon Thy sure protection, Thy blessed guidance, and Thy tender
mercies, now and <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>ever.&nbsp; So that when the hour of our departure
shall come, we may humbly trust, through Thy grace, to meet death
without fear or amazement; and stedfast through faith, and joyful
through hope, to commit our souls to Thy safekeeping, O blessed
Lord, as unto a faithful Creator and Redeemer, when Thou, in Thy
infinite wisdom and goodness, shall see it fitting to take us
unto Thyself.&nbsp; Vouchsafe, we earnestly implore Thee, O
Almighty and most merciful God, to receive favourably these our
humble petitions for ourselves and for all mankind, offered with
deep humility and self-abasement to Thy divine Majesty, in the
name and through the mediation of Thy Son, our most blessed Lord
and Saviour, to whom, with Thee, and the Holy Ghost, be ascribed,
as is most due, all honour and glory, dominion and power,
thanksgiving and praise, and humble adoration, henceforth and for
evermore.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>A Prayer</i>, <i>which may be
used in Health or in Sickness</i>.</p>
<p>O <span class="smcap">Almighty</span> and most merciful God,
who so loved the world, that Thou gavest Thy only-begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have
everlasting life, grant unto us, Thy weak and sinful servants, we
most humbly beseech Thee, sincere repentance and lively faith;
that coming to our blessed Lord, as the Way, and the Truth, and
the Life, we may, through His infinite and most precious merits,
obtain pardon and peace.&nbsp; We are sensible, O Lord, of our
natural corruption and hardness of heart, of the number and
heinousness of our offences, and yet we are little acquainted
with the extent of that corruption and guilt; for who knoweth the
deceitfulness of his wicked heart, or who can tell how oft he
offendeth?&nbsp; <a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>We deserve at Thy hand, O God, nothing but
condemnation; and should utterly despair, were it not for the
gracious assurance given in Thy Holy Scriptures, that Thou, O
Lord, waitest to be gracious, and that the blood of Jesus Christ,
Thy Son, cleanseth us from all sin.</p>
<p>We know that we are not sufficient of ourselves to think any
thing as of ourselves, but that our sufficiency is of Thee, who
workest in us both to will and to do, of Thy good pleasure.&nbsp;
We beseech Thee, therefore, O God, to be graciously pleased, for
Christ&rsquo;s sake, to enlighten, by Thy heavenly grace, the
natural darkness of our understandings, to rectify the perversion
of our wills, and to sanctify the unholiness of our
affections.&nbsp; We deplore, O Lord, our deadness to spiritual
things: oh! of Thy great goodness, strengthen, we pray Thee, our
faith, quicken our zeal, increase our love, and improve our
obedience.&nbsp; Oh! grant us, according to the riches of Thy
glory, to be strengthened with might by Thy Spirit in the inner
man; that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith; that we being
rooted and grounded in love, may be filled with the fruits of the
Spirit, may adorn in all things the doctrine of God our Saviour,
and may know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge.&nbsp;
That, having received the adoption of sons, the Spirit may bear
witness with our spirit, that we are Thy children, O gracious
God, to whom looking as unto a reconciled Father in Christ Jesus,
we may cry, Abba, Father.&nbsp; And we may have our conversation
in Heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord
Jesus Christ; who shall change our vile body, that it may be
fashioned like unto His glorious body, according to the working,
whereby He is able even to subdue all things unto Himself.</p>
<p>O Lord Jesu Christ, the Lamb of God, that takest <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>away the
sins of the world, have mercy upon us, and cleanse us by Thy
precious blood, from the defilement of our past offences: Oh!
enable us to come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may
obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.&nbsp; O
Almighty and merciful God, who art faithful, and who wilt not
suffer us to be tempted above that we are able; but wilt with the
temptation also make a way to escape, that we may be able to bear
it: we cast all our care on Thee, who carest for us: And oh!
mayest Thou, Heavenly Father, who hast, of Thy free and unmerited
mercy, begun a good work in us, perform it until the day of Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>Of Thy tender mercy, we beseech Thee, shed abroad in our
hearts the consolations of Thy Gospel, and enrich us with
Christian graces, that we may be supported under whatever
afflictions Thou mayest be pleased to send, and receive them, and
seek for grace to benefit by them, as being sent, gracious Lord,
by Thee, in mercy and for our profit.&nbsp; That, under Thy most
mighty protection and blessing, we may fight the good fight of
faith, lay hold on eternal life, and finish our course with joy;
by Him and through Him, to whom has been given a name that is
above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should
bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under
the earth: and that every tongue should confess, that Jesus
Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&nbsp; Amen,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
